      <p>
        The server
        <link href="ext:forrest-zone">forrest.zones.apache.org</link>
        provides our testing and demonstration area.
        It is managed by Apache Forrest committers.

      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        Configuration files and directory structures are stored in SVN at
        <code>https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/zone</code>

directories /forrestbot-*/ are the forrestbot homes, see below.
setenv*.sh ... these are sourced by the forrestbots and other
  cronjobs and user configs, to set the environment.

A place to hold sources for various test sites.
Normally these would be in the relevant project's SVN.
Hold them here until building properly.

      <p>
        All files are owned in the group "other" so any one of us can
        edit/update. Make sure that your 'umask' is set properly so that
        new files have group write permissions.
        See the <link href="#admin-user">notes</link> about user administration.
 FIXME: Add a proper group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cron runs the various Forrestbots and management tasks, such as
        updating the forrest-trunk software; cleaning up old logfiles, etc.
        FIXME: These are not yet managed under SVN, see ~crossley/my-crontab.txt

      <title>The forrestbots</title>
      <p>
        There are various forrestbots operating with different versions
        of forrest.
        Their home is at $CONFIG
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>$CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk</strong>
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve">
forrestbot operating with trunk.
builds various sites automatically, triggered via cron.
Configuration files and the generated results are at $DOC_ROOT/ft/
FIXME: The web interface is coming soon.
</source>

      <p>
        <strong>$CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk-stable</strong>
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve">
forrestbot operating with trunk-stable.
builds various sites, only runs when needed, triggered via cron.
Configuration files and the generated results are at $DOC_ROOT/fts/
</source>

      <p>
        Forrestbot logs are at
        $CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk*/logs/
        and old ones are cleaned up by the crontab.
        There is also a log file for each site that forrestbot builds
        which captures the output of cron (cronout-*.txt).
        Be sure to verify this logfile after making configuration changes.

      <title>Administration</title>
      <p>
        See the general notes for the
        <link href="http://www.apache.org/dev/solaris-zones.html">zone administration</link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project chair is the root user.
        Committers can ask on the dev list to get a user account added or modified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow Leo's config ideas at
        <link href="http://wiki.apache.org/gump/GumpZonesConfig">GumpZonesConfig</link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also keep an occasional eye on
        $CONFIG/update-forrest-trunk.log
        This is the output of the cronjob to do svn update to trunk
        and re-build.
      </p>
      <p>
        FIXME:
        Start apache2 on boot (using new Solaris init.d replacement called smf).
        At the moment we need to realise that it is down and manually
        restart as per http://www.apache.org/dev/solaris-zones.html
        Also it seems that /var/run/apache2 is wiped out on reboot,
        so need to mkdir again.

        <p>
          Look at the setup of some other users on our zone.
