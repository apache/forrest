        New site seeding mechanism. You can now run "forrest seed" as before, or you can run
        "forrest seedBusiness". The later will ask a number of questions about the site
        being seeded (business name, description etc.) and will create a very simple site
        designed for business. To quickly see the results, i.e. avoid
        answeriung the questions, do "forrest seedTestBusiness". More seed sites will be added
        in the future.

        Added support for a locationmap. This enables content to be retrieved from a location
        that is defined in a locationmap file (located at 
        PROJECT_HOME/src/documentation/content/locationmap.xml file. The
        advantage of this is that the URL seen by the user need bear no relation to the location
        of the source document, thus Forrest can separate the client URL space from the source
        docuement URL space. Thus, using the locationmap it is possible to pull together
        documents from many different locations into a single uniform site.
        
        In addition, since the user URL space is now unconnected to the source URL space
        it is possible to move source documents without breaking any existing user links.
        
        See locationmap docs for more information.
