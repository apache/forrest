    <faq id="catalog-less">
      <question>
        How does the DTD catalog-less resolving work?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Using .htaccess and re-write rules to svn URLs.
          See <link href="http://issues.cocoondev.org/jira/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?key=FOR-107">Issue FOR-107</link>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note the broken PublicIdentifier in this document's DOCTYPE declaration.
          This means that the catalog entity resolver cannot find the DTD
          locally and so the agent needs to go to the SystemIdentifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try the following test and be horrified at the effect of dragging
          DTDs and related bits-and-pieces across the network.

    <faq id="test">
      <question>
        How to test it?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        Using your favourite XML editor, first
        <link href="http://forrest.apache.org/catalog.html">configure</link>
        the catalog entity resolver. Make sure it works for normal xml editing
        of xdocs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now try to open this ./faq.xml which will force your editor
         to get the current DTD from the network.
        </p>
        <p>
         For a nice simple test do '<code>xmllint --noout --valid faq.xml</code>'
