Subject: [VOTE] please review release candidate then vote

We need people to review the release candidate and to
test it on your projects, especially on different operating
systems and Java version. See testing hints below.

Download the release candidate and supporting files:
http://people.apache.org/~[### your apache ID ###]/temp/forrest-###08###-rc1/

For Windows get *.zip (md5sum ################################)
For UNIX get *.tar.gz (md5sum ################################)
Get the *.asc and *.md5 that match your chosen download.

Java [### JavaVersion ###] or later is required.

Testing and vote period concludes [#### Date #####] [2].
Anyone can test and vote, not just PMC members.
However only the PMC votes are binding [3].

When voting, quote the md5sum to ensure that we are all
using the correct release candidate package. The votes
need to happen against the final release package.

PMC members need to satisfy themselves that the actual
final release package meets the ASF principles.

Please wait with voting until towards the end of the
week, as we may need to build a second release candidate
if there are any changes to the code or documentation [1].

During this week we do need to hear about both successes
and failures. Please report your operating system
and Java versions and Jetty/Tomcat versions.

So we have approximately 6 days.

Here are some hints for actual testing:

  * Verify the release, especially if you are a committer.
    Follow: http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi#verify
  * Ensure that the compressed archive will unpack properly.
  * Follow the README.txt and index.html
  * Set $FORREST_HOME and $PATH appropriately.
  * Try it with different Java versions.
  * Try it with different versions of Apache Tomcat or Jetty.
  * Many known issues are already recorded at our Jira.
  * Don't worry too much about minor bugs. We are looking
    for blockers, such as it will not run.
  * Please add other discovered issues to Jira.

* Make a fresh site ...
    cd my-new-dir
    forrest seed-sample
    forrest run ... use the local jetty server.
    forrest ... build the whole site from the command-line.
    forrest war ... use your own full Jetty or Tomcat.

* Try it on the Forrest core docs ...
    cd site-author
    forrest run
    forrest

* Forrest was already pre-built. Try building it again.
    cd main
    build clean
    build
    build test-sample

* Try it on your own project, especially if you have
    a project sitemap and use some extra plugins.

* If you are a user of forrestbot then try that.

* Try building and installing the forrestbar.
