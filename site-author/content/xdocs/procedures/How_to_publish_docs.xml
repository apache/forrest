      <p>
        All documentation about Apache Forrest is managed as a Forrest-built
        project located in the site-author directory of forrest/trunk SVN. The
        Apache Forrest website is updated by generating static pages from the
        site-author-project and committing them to the forrest/site SVN, which
        is then 'svn checkout' on the forrest.apache.org webserver to create the
        website.

      <title>Updating the site with a local forrestbot</title>
      <p>
        Do once, create $FORREST_HOME/deploy.svn.settings file. These
        credentials are needed by forrestbot so that it can do your 'svn add'
        and 'svn commit' etc. to the forrest/site/ repository. The
        deploy.svn.settings file looks like:
      </p>
      <source>
<![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project>
    <property name="deploy.svn.user" value="myApacheUsername"/>
    <property name="deploy.svn.password" value="myPassword"/>
</project>]]>
      </source>
      <p>
        Generating and publishing the main docs is very easy using a local
        forrestbot:
      </p>
      <source>cd site-author
forrest -f publish.xml build
forrest -f publish.xml deploy</source>
      <p>
        This builds the documentation locally then deploys it by committing it
        to the
        <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/site">forrest/site
        SVN</a>. Then a cronjob on the server will automatically publish it.
        However, if instant turnaround is required, then do this:
      </p>
      <source>ssh people.apache.org
cd /www/forrest.apache.org
svn update</source>
      <p>
        Publishing documentation for a particular plugin is done by:
      </p>
      <source>cd plugins/myPluginName
$FORREST_HOME/tools/ant/bin/ant deploy-docs</source>
      <p>
        See further information in the
        <a href="site:buildPlugin">buildPlugin</a> doc.
      </p>
      <p>
        See some general notes about managing
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/project-site.html">project

        There have been a few explantions of our docs processing on the
        forrest-dev mail list. Need to glean the info from them. Here is the
        content of some:

                To publish from trunk/site-author/
                
                Do once:
                # Create $FORREST_HOME/deploy.svn.settings file. These credentials
                # are needed by forrestbot so that it can do your 'svn add'
                # and 'svn commit' etc. to the forrest/site/ repository.
                # The deploy.svn.settings file looks like:
                <?xml version="1.0"?>
                <project>
                    <property name="deploy.svn.user" value="myApacheUsername"/>
                    <property name="deploy.svn.password" value="myPassword"/>
                </project>
                
                
                # Make changes to sources, and then test, then commit.
                # Best to wait on committing the source changes until
                # you have built and reviewed the docs.

                # Please, please, ensure valid xml docs. Errors will be
                # reported during the 'build' phase if you don't.
                # Also it prevents other people from working with the docs,
                # which goes against the collaborative development process.

                # You can do 'forrest validate-xdocs" beforehand or use
                # a validating editor (link: catalog.html) or for a single doc use
                # xmllint (link: catalog.html) from the command-line, e.g.
                # xmllint --noout --valid --catalogs faq.xml

                # Use the forrestbot to build and then deploy to svn.apache.org ...
                
                cd site-author
                forrest -f publish.xml build
                # ... verify files in build/forrest-docs
                forrest -f publish.xml deploy -Ddeploy.svn.commit-message="my commit message"
                
                Now the files are in SVN at forrest/site
                Periodically the real website files are updated from there.
                You do not have to do anything else.
                
                ----------------------
                Note: The first time that you deploy, it will need to do
                a long svn checkout first.
                
                FIXME: That commit message technique does not work.
                The second word is treated as an ant target to be called.
                Just leave it out and forrestbot will use a default message.
                 ]]>
      </source>
      <p>
        Some more notes that need to be integrated above ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that forrestbot does not remove docs from the forrest/site SVN
        (FOR-392). So need to manually delete: 'cd /svn/forrest/site; svn delete
        oldDoc'. Then remove it from the forrestbot work directories: 'cd
        $FORREST_HOME/site-author; rm build/forrest-docs/oldDoc; rm
        work/svn-deploy/forrest-docs/oldDoc'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The generated docs are in build/forrest-docs which is the name given to
        it in the forrestbot descriptor (site-author/publish.xml). Here is a
        trick for reviewing changes that forrestbot is ready to deploy ...
      </p>
      <source>
forrest -f publish.xml build
svn update work/svn-deploy/forrest-docs
diff -rq build/forrest-docs work/svn-deploy/forrest-docs | grep -v "\.svn" | grep differ</source>
      <p>
        If you change something that affects all pages (e.g. layout changes; navigation
        menu additions or MOTD changes that affect old "versioned docs")
        then see the note in conf/cli.xconf about temporarily not excluding
        old "docs_*" patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there have been changes to tools/forrestbar then need to follow the
        instructions there to build it. Then copy its build/forrestbar.xpi to
        site-author/content/xdocs/tools/forrestbar.xpi and commit that. Then run
        forrestbot to build and deploy the site, or alternatively for a quick
        fix, just commit it to forest/site/tools (which is what forrestbot would do).
