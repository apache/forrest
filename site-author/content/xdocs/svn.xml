  <body>
    <p>
      The version control system Subversion is used by all ASF projects to
      manage their source code and other resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Forrest "trunk" is where the main development happens. From time-to-time
      "branches" are used for specific short-term development tasks and later
      merged to trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developers can browse the trunk via
      <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/">direct access</a> or
      via the <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/forrest/trunk">ViewVC web
      interface</a>.
      Pay attention to LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files.
      Similarly branches can be browsed (go up one level).
    </p>
    <p>
      For every change, a notification email is automatically sent to the
      <a href="site:mail-lists">svn@ mailing list</a>. Subscribe to that list or
      search the archives to keep up-to-date with changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developers can work with the most recent sources rather than a released
      version, follow the <a href="site:build">instructions</a> to checkout your
      working copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      See other <a href="site:svnBP">best practice notes</a>.
