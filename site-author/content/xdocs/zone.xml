      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        Note the current hostname is forrest-vm.apache.org. Links in this
        text have been updated but not all uses of the name forrest.zones.apache.org.

      <p>
        The server <a href="ext:forrest-zone">forrest-vm.apache.org</a>
        provides our testing and demonstration area. It is managed by Apache
        Forrest committers. The material is intended for developer use only.

      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        Configuration files and directory structures are stored in SVN at
        <a href="ext:forrest-zone/svn">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/zone</a> and
        additional private stuff is in our pmc/forrest/zone SVN.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current environment is a virtual machine provisioned using
        configuration information stored using <a href="ext:forrest-zone/puppet">Puppet</a>.
      </p>

        Configuration changes may be applied by submitting a
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">pull request</a>.
        Fork the <a href="https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet">repository</a>,
        make your changes on a topic branch based on deployment branch, and submit your request.

A place to hold sources for various test sites.
Normally these would be in the relevant project's SVN.
Hold them here until building properly.

        Cron runs the various Forrestbots and management tasks, such as updating
        the forrest-trunk software; cleaning up old logfiles, etc. A copy of the
        crontab is stored in SVN at <code>zone/config/crontab.txt</code>.

      <title>The forrestbots</title>
      <p>
        There are various forrestbots operating with different versions of
        forrest. Their home is at $CONFIG
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>$CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk</strong>
      </p>
      <source>

builds various sites automatically, triggered via cron.
Configuration files and the generated results are at $DOC_ROOT/ft/

      <p>
        <strong>$CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk-stable</strong>
      </p>
      <source>
forrestbot operating with trunk-stable.
builds various sites, only runs when needed, triggered via cron.
Configuration files and the generated results are at $DOC_ROOT/fts/
</source>
    </section>
    <section id="logs">
      <title>Log files</title>
      <p>
        Forrestbot logs are at <code>$CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk/logs/</code>
        and old ones are cleaned up daily by the crontab.
        The content is sent to the dev list whenever a non-successful build happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cocoon logfiles for each built site are at
        <code>$CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk/conf/work/*/webapp/WEB-INF/logs/</code>
        (which of course are re-generated on each hourly run).
        These are saved to
        <code>$CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk/logs/*-cocoon-log-*.tar.gz</code>
        to assist with debugging.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a log file for each site that
        forrestbot builds which captures the output of cron (cronout-*.txt). Be
        sure to verify this logfile after making configuration changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever the 'forrest' software automatically updates following commits,
        then there will be a logfile at the <code>$CONFIG</code> top-level directory.
        Old ones are cleaned up daily by the crontab.

        See the general notes for the

        administration</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project chair is the root user. Committers can ask on the dev list
        to get a user account added or modified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monitor the infrastructure@
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/infra-mail.html">mail lists</a>
        for changes to the 
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/machines.html#jails-tlps">machine</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep an eye on the status via the
        <a href="http://status.apache.org/">monitoring</a> service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally the "SSL server certificate" will change for svn.apache.org
        server. Monitor the infrastructure and committers mail lists, and see
        infra
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html#cert">notes</a>
        about this topic.

      <p>
        If you think that you need to contact
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/infra-contact">infra</a>
        about anything, then please try our Forrest dev or private list first.
        See the monitor page for
        <a href="http://status.apache.org/">Service Status</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep an occasional eye on $CONFIG/update-forrest-trunk.log This is
        the output of the cronjob to do svn update to trunk and re-build.
