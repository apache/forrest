      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        The server <a href="ext:forrest-zone">forrest.zones.apache.org</a>
        provides our testing and demonstration area. It is managed by Apache
        Forrest committers. The material is intended for developer use only.

      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        Configuration files and directory structures are stored in SVN at
        <code>https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/zone</code> and
        additional private stuff is in our pmc/forrest/zone SVN.
      </p>
      <note label="Config">
creates /export/home/config ... $CONFIG
directories /forrestbot-*/ are the forrestbot homes, see below.
setenv*.sh ... these are sourced by the forrestbots and other
  cronjobs and user configs, to set the environment.

      <note label="htdocs">

directories /ft/ and /fts/ are the forrestbot config and results, see below.

      <note label="test-sources">
A place to hold sources for various test sites.
Normally these would be in the relevant project's SVN.
Hold them here until building properly.
      </note>
      <p>
        All files are owned in the group "other" so any one of us can
        edit/update. Make sure that your 'umask' is set properly so that new
        files have group write permissions. See the
        <a href="#admin-user">notes</a> about user administration. FIXME: Add a
        proper group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cron runs the various Forrestbots and management tasks, such as updating
        the forrest-trunk software; cleaning up old logfiles, etc. FIXME: These
        are not yet managed under SVN, see ~crossley/my-crontab.txt

        There are various forrestbots operating with different versions of

      <p>
        Forrestbot logs are at $CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk*/logs/ and old ones are
        cleaned up by the crontab. There is also a log file for each site that
        forrestbot builds which captures the output of cron (cronout-*.txt). Be
        sure to verify this logfile after making configuration changes.

      <title>Administration</title>
      <p>
        See the general notes for the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/solaris-zones.html">zone
        administration</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project chair is the root user. Committers can ask on the dev list
        to get a user account added or modified.
      </p>
      <p>
        As requested by that infra doc, keep our zone info up-to-date (see
        https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/infrastructure/trunk/docs/helios/zones.txt).
      </p>
      <p>
       We have minimally configured our zone. See some other projects' config ideas, e.g.
        <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/gump/GumpZonesConfig">GumpZonesConfig</a>
        and those of us on the Cocoon PMC can see their config in their "pmc" SVN.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monitor the infrastructure@ mailing list for changes to the 
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/machines.html#helios">zones machine</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think that you need to contact
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/reporting-issues.html">infra</a>
        about anything, then please try our Forrest dev or private list first.
        See the monitor page for
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/#status">Service Status</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep an occasional eye on $CONFIG/update-forrest-trunk.log This is
        the output of the cronjob to do svn update to trunk and re-build.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Forrest zone is set up using SMF and so should always come back up
        automatically after a failure or reboot. See how it is configured on the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/solaris-zones.html#apache2_smf"> Apache2
        SMF</a> section of the Solaris Zones page.

          After receiving your account, please be sure to configure it properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          See some notes at
          <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/solaris-zones.html">zone
          administration</a> and the general notes for
          <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html#shell">new
          committers</a> (especially the part about 'umask').
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the setup of some other users on our zone.
