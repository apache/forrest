      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        There are many tasks that need to be done to keep the project flowing.
        With the tasks being well-defined, the hope is that various people will
        be able to assist to carry out the tasks and so not rely on a couple of
        individuals to do all the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no roles for "leadership" of technical areas. We don't have
        the concept of leadership at the ASF. Rather these are "functional
        tasks".
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not intended to put pressure on people to force them to do work
        nor "pull their weight". If they do not manage to do a task, then
        someone else will be able to do it. Of course, shared load means a
        healthy project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most tasks are not too onerous. For example, for
        the "Documentation Coordination", the only job might be to publish the
        documentation every Friday. Sure it can be done at other times and other
        people can do it too, but at least it gets done once per week.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a person doing a task does not mean that everyone can leave it to
        them and rely on them. Anyone else can dive in and do the job (for
        example, publish the docs twice per week). The more people who are
        familiar with the task, the better. Perhaps the person who is primarily
        doing that task will notice that there can be improvements to how they
        are doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a person is dissatisfied with the way a particular task is being done
        then find a way to offer constructive criticism, perhaps by assisting or
        by enhancing the task documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the tasks (except of course the Developer role) can only be
        carried out by PMC members because commit access is required.
      </p>

    <section id="tasks">
      <title>The tasks</title>
      <p>
        These are the main tasks, including the obvious ones. There are probably
        other tasks that need to be defined also. Each task should have some
        continually enhanced documentation about it, so that any person can do
        the tasks.
      </p>
      <section id="pmc-member">
        <title>PMC Member</title>
        <p>
          This is well-defined in our <a href="site:guidelines">project
          guidelines</a> and in the top-level ASF docs.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="pmc-chair">
        <title>PMC Chair</title>

          Tasks are defined in <a href="site:howToRelease">How to Release
          Forrest</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Only one person can do this role, although other people can assist.
          There is a lot of knowledge invested in this role. Document it as much
          as possible.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="forrest-friday-coordination">
        <title>ForrestFriday Coordination</title>
        <p>
          The tasks are defined in
          <a href="site:forrest-friday">ForrestFriday</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each month someone needs to co-ordinate the IRC session and be the
          main channel operator, maintain the logfile and commit it to the
          events SVN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ensure that the session is summarised.
        </p>
        <p>
          This task can possibly be done by someone who is not a committer.
          However, a logfile and summary need to be committed to SVN.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="issue-tracker-coordination">
        <title>Issue Tracker Coordination</title>
        <p>
          Add new Components, e.g. for each new plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other general Admin tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add new committers to the forrest-administrators group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add/enhance <a href="site:bugs">Filters</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Review issues to ensure that they are properly categorised. This is
          best done as soon as a new issue comes in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Review the list of unscheduled issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each month get the project to review the outstanding major issues that
          are scheduled for the upcoming release.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="documentation-coordination">
        <title>Documentation Coordination</title>
        <p>
          Publish the documentation at least once per week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Various people make edits to the source files, but often the
          documentation is not generated and published. Also people add new
          entries to site-author/status.xml but the changes.html needs to be
          regularly generated from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This task is not actually about doing the documentation. That should
          be up to everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generating and publishing the main docs is very easy using a local
          forrestbot: See <a href="site:howToPublishDocs">How to publish Forrest
          documentation</a>.

        <p>
          Ensure that svn:eol-style settings are "native" for all text files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ensure no line-endings issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regularly run xml-tidy. (Not yet ready.)

          Regularly run java-tidy. (Not yet ready.)

          There are already some Perl scripts and other tools in the
          "<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers">committers</a>"
          SVN in the "tools" directory.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="legal-monitoring">
        <title>Legal Monitoring</title>
        <p>
          Regularly run a script which verifies and inserts missing license
          headers to source files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regularly ensure that there are appropriate matching licenses to
          accompany each supporting product that we redistribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          This should have continual oversight by the PMC as a whole, but the
          monitoring is something that needs to be done regularly, and
          definitely prior to each release.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are already some Perl scripts and other tools in the
          "<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers">committers</a>"
          SVN in the "tools" and "relicense/src/perl" directories.

        <title>Developer</title>
        <p>
          The above tasks are only for PMC Members. How can the Developers be
          involved? That is easy: do the Developer Role.
        </p>
        <p>
          Help out with commenting on the Issue Tracker, fixing the issues,
          contributing to discussion, contributing patches, turning discussion
          into clear documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is incredibly valuable and will enable the project to grow. After
          time, you will probably be elected as Committer/PMC Member and when
          comfortable, can take on one of the Project Management Roles.
