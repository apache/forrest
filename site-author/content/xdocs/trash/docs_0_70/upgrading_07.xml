      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        This page describes some changes to Apache Forrest that affect people
        who are upgrading to the 0.7 version. If you have other issues, then
        please discuss on either the
        <a href="site:mail-lists/forrest-dev">dev</a> or
        <a href="site:mail-lists/forrest-user">user</a> mailing lists. As more
        experience is gained, this document will be updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        (If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.6 then you will need to
        see the notes for the previous upgrade.)

    <section id="new">
      <title>New Features</title>
      <p>
        The following list shows some of the key new features (for the full list
        of changes, see the <a href="site:changes">change log</a>).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plugin architecture</li>
        <li>Java 1.4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As usual, do a "forrest seed site" in a new directory and compare the
        forrest.properties and skinconf.xml with that of your project.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="clean">
      <title>Run a clean target after upgrade</title>
      <p>
        Do 'forrest clean-work' in each of your projects. This also removes the
        old Cocoon disk cache.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="home">
      <title>New location of $FORREST_HOME</title>
      <p>
        $FORREST_HOME is now the top-level of the distribution. Also make sure
        $PATH gets updated to use the new $FORREST_HOME/bin
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="jdk14">
      <title>Java 1.4 (or newer) is required</title>
      <p>
        Java 1.4 (or newer) is required, starting with this Forrest 0.7 version.
        For further information, see
        <a href="site:faq/requirements">FAQ</a>.

      <p>
        Synchronise your project's skinconf.xml and forrest.properties files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take advantage of the separation of concerns. In a new workspace, create
        a fresh '<code>forrest seed</code>' site, then tweak its
        forrest.properties and skinconf.xml until it reflects your old site.
        When it is ready, replace your project's skinconf.xml and
        forrest.properties files. Any remaining issues would concern other
        aspects of your configuration, such as site.xml and your actual content.

      <title>Plugin architecture</title>
      <p>
        See <a href="site:plugins/infrastructure">Plugin Infrastructure</a> and
        <a href="site:plugins/using">Extending Forrest with Plugins</a> and for
        developing new plugins see <a href="site:buildPlugin">How
        to Build a Plugin</a>. See the list of
        <a href="site:plugins/index">current plugins</a> and their
        documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that other experimental plugins can be found in the
        "whiteboard/plugins" directory.
      </p>

    <section id="configure-plugin">
      <title>Configure plugins</title>
      <p>
        Some functionality has been moved out of the forrest core and into
        plugins. You will need to declare any plugins that are used by your
        project, e.g. if you use projectInfo (status, changes, todo) and PDF
        output, then declare the following in forrest.properties
      </p>
      <source>
project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.projectInfo,org.apache.forrest.plugin.output.pdf
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="raw">
      <title>Including raw un-processed content</title>
      <p>
        The method for including "raw un-processed content" has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 0.6 version, the raw content was placed in the
        src/documentation/content/ directory and potential sub-directories. In
        the generated site, these links would automatically function. Any linked
        file with .html extension was not processed and not adorned with Forrest
        skin and navigation menus.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was also possible to place HTML content in the xdocs directory where
        it would be copied across if it was linked from the main content.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 0.7 version, any file that is linked to, needs to be placed in the
        content/xdocs/ directory structure. Any linked file with .html extension
        is now processed and is adorned with Forrest skin and navigation menus.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you you wish to emulate the behaviour of 0.6 and earlier then you
        must add the following to your project sitemap.
      </p>
      <source>
&lt;map:match pattern="**.html"&gt;
 &lt;map:select type="exists"&gt;
  &lt;map:when test="{properties:content}{0}"&gt;
    &lt;map:read src="{properties:content}/{0}" mime-type="text/html"/&gt;
    &lt;!--
      Use this instead if you want JTidy to clean up your HTML
      &lt;map:generate type="html" src="{properties:content}/{0}" /&gt;
      &lt;map:serialize type="html"/&gt;
    --&gt;
  &lt;/map:when&gt;
  &lt;map:when test="{properties:content.xdocs}{0}"&gt;
    &lt;map:read src="{properties:content.xdocs}/{0}" mime-type="text/html"/&gt;
    &lt;!--
      Use this instead if you want JTidy to clean up your HTML
      &lt;map:generate type="html" src="{properties:content.xdocs}/{0}" /&gt;
      &lt;map:serialize type="html"/&gt;
    --&gt;
  &lt;/map:when&gt;
 &lt;/map:select&gt;
&lt;/map:match&gt;
        </source>
      <p>
        If you need to include files that are not linked to, then place them in
        the src/documentation/content/ directories as with the 0.6 version.
      </p>
