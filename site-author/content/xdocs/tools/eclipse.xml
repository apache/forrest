      <title>Wizards</title>
      <p>
        A number of wizards are provided for performing common tasks. This
        section briefly describes the available wizards.
      </p>
      <section id="newProject">
        <title>Creating a new Forrest Project</title>
        <p>
          To create a new Forrest project select "New Project" from either the
          context menu in the package explorer or the "New" menu and select
          Forrest -> Seed New Project.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Project Name and Location</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A wizard will ask you for the name of the project and the location in
          which the project files are to be created (by default the files will
          be in your current workspace). When you are done, click on Next
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Site options</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here you will see the Site Options page. This is where you can specify
          certain options for your new site. Currently the available options
          are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Group Name</li>
          <li>Project Name</li>
          <li>Vendor</li>
          <li>Copyright link</li>
          <li>Disable PDF link</li>
          <li>Disable POD link</li>
          <li>Disable Print link</li>
          <li>Disable Text link</li>
          <li>Disable XML link</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There is also an option to save these sselections as your default
          settings. If this is done, the next time you create a project it will
          have the same seelections that you have specified here. When you are
          finished with this page, click on Next
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Activate Plugins</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This page allows you to select the plugins that you would like your
          project to use. The list of available plugins is on the left and list
          of plugins that you have chosen for your project is on the right. Once
          you have selected those plugins click on Finish to create your new
          Site Project.

      <title>Editors</title>
      <p>
        A number of editors are provided for Forrest configuration files. This
        section describes those editors.

          </title>
        <p>

          structure of the site.xml as a tree in the view.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two ways to add the note to the site.xml file.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
                Drag a file from the Package Explorer to the tree. This will create a new element 
                with references to that dropped file(s).
              </li>
          <li>
                Right click on an element in the site.xml tree and select "Add Element". A wizard will come up which will allow you to enter the HREF, Description, Label and Element name for the new element that is being added.
