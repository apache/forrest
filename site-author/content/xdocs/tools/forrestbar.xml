      <title>What is the ForrestBar?</title>
      <p>
        The ForrestBar is a toolbar extension made for the
        <link href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla</link>
        and <link href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</link>
        browsers that eases the navigation of online Apache Forrest resources
        (including local instances of Forrest running on jetty or as a webapp),
        Apache links and other Apache projects.
        It also provides targetted searches for Forrest resources, e.g. search
        mail lists and issue tracker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Navigation and developer assistance for Apache Forrest-related
        documentation frameworks.

      <title>Installing the ForrestBar</title>
      <p>
        ForrestBar is currently compatible with Firefox 0.9 - 2.0+ and Mozilla
        1.x browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Select this link to <link href="forrestbar.xpi">install</link>
        ForrestBar.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the extension does not automatically install for you when clicking on
        the link, download ForrestBar by right clicking on the link and select
        Save As... to save the file to your computer. To install, simply drag
        the downloaded .xpi file into your browser's window and drop it.
      </p>
      <p>
        To build (and perhaps enhance) ForrestBar locally rather than downloading, go to
        FORREST_HOME/tools/forrestbar and follow the README.txt document.
        The .xpi file will be built for
        you in the FORREST_HOME/tools/forrestbar/build directory. You can then
        install it by dragging and dropping as indicated above, or open the file.

        <ul>
          <li>Access to "abs-menulinks" which is the internal representation
            of the "site.xml" navigation configuration. See

          </p>
        </section>
        <section>

            contracts available whereas the <em>ls.contracts.project</em> only
            displays the list of contracts specific to the project.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Search Archives menu</title>
        <p>
          This menu lets you search in different Forrest related archives or

          <li>The Jira Issues - site which manages Forrest issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To perfom a search in one of these sites, just enter a keyword in the
          Search field and select the site you want to search in in the Search
          menu.
        </p>
        <note label="Jira Issues">
          If you enter the number of a Forrest issue you are working on (let's
          say FOR-962) the search in the JIRA Issues site will directly access to
          the Issue properties page.
        </note>
        <note label="Subversion revisions">
          Subversion revision gives you a direct access to the revision you
          entered in the search field (let's say 521779).
        </note>
        <note label="Mail Message-Id">
          This is very useful to obtain a URL to reference a previous
          discussion. Searches for a Message-Id at the Gmane.org service.
          Select "Subject" to obtain a "thread-and-focus" URL.
        </note>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Search Dispatcher menu</title>
        <warning>
          This menu needs the <em>Local Forrest</em> site to be launched, i.e.
          <code>'forrest run'</code> mode.
          The site needs to be enabled to use the Dispatcher.
        </warning>
        <p>
          This menu gives you direct access to Dispatcher contracts. You can access to html
          or fo contract by entering the contract name in the search field and
          selecting the corresponding <em>prepare</em> or <em>resolve</em>
          option.
        </p>
        <p>
          These accesses are very useful to check that the contract you are
          working on is found by the dispatcher and is syntactically correct.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="configure">
      <title>Configuring the ForrestBar</title>
      <p>
        ForrestBar can be configured in order to change the <em>localhost</em>
        and <em>port</em> used to connect to Forrest dynamic site, i.e. if you
        have changed <code>'forrest run'</code> mode to use a
        <link href="site:faq/run_port">different port</link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The defaults are <code>localhost:8888</code> and can be changed through
        the Options window :
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/forrest-bar-options.png" alt="ForrestBar Options window"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have entered the correct values for your installation, the
        ForrestBar saves them in your browser user preferences so that they will
        be used again next time you will start your browser.
