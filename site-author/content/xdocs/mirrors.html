    <h1><a name="how" />How to download</h1>
    <p class="note">
      Please realise that Forrest is still pre-1.0 release version. It is
      certainly usable for those who are prepared to move with it. See more
      notes about <a href="index.html#status">status</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the links below to download a distribution of Apache Forrest from one
      of our mirrors. It is good practice to <a href="[location]#verify">verify
      the integrity</a> of the distribution files.
      Apache Forrest releases are available under the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>
      - see the README.txt and LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files contained in each release artifact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apache Forrest is distributed as a <code>zip</code> archive (for Windows)
      and as a <code>tar.gz</code> archive (for UNIX). The contents are the
      same, the only difference is the line-endings of all text files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distribution contains all of the source code, documentation, and
      resources, together with the pre-built ready-to-run forrest binary. It
      also includes pre-packaged copies of relevant portions of Apache Cocoon
      and Apache Ant, and supporting products.
    </p>
    <p>
      After unpacking the distribution, follow the README.txt to see the
      Requirements (just Java 1.5+), Installation Instructions and
      Documentation, Licensing and legal issues and credits.

    <h1><a name="archive" />Archive of old releases</h1>
    <p>
      Older releases are available in the
      <a
href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/forrest/">archive</a>. Those
      releases are only provided as historical artefacts. We strongly recommend
      to not use those releases, but upgrade to the most recent release.
    </p>
    <h1><a name="verify" />Verify releases</h1>
    <p>
      It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files
      using the MD5 and PGP signatures. MD5 verification ensures the file was
      not corrupted or tampered with. PGP verification ensures that the file
      came from a certain person.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="pgp" />PGP Signature</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>
      signatures can be verified using tools such as
      <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>. First download the Apache Forrest
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/forrest/KEYS">KEYS</a> as well as the
      <code>*.asc</code> signature file for the particular distribution. It is
      important that you get these files from the ultimate trusted source - the
      main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror. Then verify the
      signatures using ...
    </p>
    <pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv apache-forrest-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp apache-forrest-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify apache-forrest-X.Y.tar.gz.asc
</pre>

    <p>
    The files <code>apache-forrest-0.9.*</code>
    are signed by David Crossley <code>3248A46E</code> (and <code>23CB7A2A</code>)
    </p>

    <h2><a name="md5" />MD5 Checksum</h2>
    <p>
      To verify the MD5 checksum on the files, you need to use a program called
      <code>md5</code> or <code>md5sum</code>, which is included in many unix
      distributions. It is also available as part of
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html">GNU
      Textutils</a>. Windows users can get binary md5 programs from
      <a
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">here</a>,
      <a
href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/">here</a>, or
      <a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/">here</a> or an openssl client
      from
      <a href="http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <pre>
% md5sum apache-forrest-X.Y.tar.gz
... output should match the string in apache-forrest-X.Y.tar.gz.md5
</pre>
    <p>
      We strongly recommend you verify your downloads with both PGP and MD5.
