      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        The Apache Forrest uses an issue tracker called Jira. All of the project
        contributions should go there (not to the mailing list). This enables us
        to keep track of contributions and to classify and manage the issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR</a>
        is the main entry point which provides access to enter, view, search,
        and add additional comments to issues. There are some additional search
        <a href="#filters">filters</a> provided below.
      </p>
      <p>
        You need to set up an account there before you can create new issues or
        add comments to existing issues. Anyone can register as a user and
        report issues. See <a href="#guide">guidelines</a> below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the issue tracker is not a discussion or user help forum.
        Please discuss issues about using Forrest on the user or dev mailing
        list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security and vulnerability issues are co-ordinated through the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/security/">ASF Security Team</a>.
        That is only for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities in
        Apache products. For other issues, use the Forrest project
        Issue tracker.

      <title>Guidelines and hints for reporting issues</title>
      <ul>
        <li>Start here <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR</a></li>
        <li>Ensure that an issue does not already exist.
        Use Jira's powerful "Find Issues" ability. Set the Project and
        Status fields. See the Help about boolean queries in the Query field.
        The easiest way to search is using our <a href="site:forrestbar">Forrestbar</a> browser add-on.
        </li>
        <li>After login, choose "Create New Issue".</li>
        <li>Follow the prompts below each entry field.</li>
        <li>If you don't know the answer to a particular question, then
        leave the field blank.</li>
        <li>Add a concise initial Description, then add more Comments later to
        further describe the issue.</li>
        <li>Other people will follow up and enhance your description and
        classifications.</li>
        <li>If details about your computing environment are relevant
        (e.g. Java version or operating system) then add them to a Comment.</li>
        <li>If you are going to also add a patch, then select "Patch available".
        (Reporters of issues can add this later via "Edit issue".)
        Follow the instructions about "Grant license" and ensure that you are
        able to do so.
        Be aware of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/public-archives.html">Public Forum Archive Policy</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <section id="priority">
        <title>Special fields: Priority (a.k.a. Severity)</title>
        <p>
          The Priority is the severity according to the issue reporter. This
          will be a guideline to the development team to identify the most
          urgent issues. It is not a guarantee that a Critical issue will be
          resolved before a Major issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the Jira help icon to see the definition of the options.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="urgency">
        <title>Special fields: Urgency</title>
        <p>
          The project team will classify this according to their urgency. The
          aim is to be able to see at a glance which issues should be attended
          to, so that developers can operate efficiently and so that the product
          can be released as soon as possible. Some issues hinder the project,
          so need to be identified.
        </p>
        <fixme author="open">
          Not sure about the project's use of the "Urgency" field. See issue
          <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-853">FOR-853</a>
        </fixme>
        <p>
          We use the following definition of the options.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          None: The default. Not yet classified.
        </li>
          <li>
          Blocker: Prevents other developers from working; or critical issue with functionality;
          or holds up the implementation of other functionality.
          Cannot release until it is fixed. Will be fixed ASAP.
        </li>
          <li>
          Urgent: Is a key new feature; or affects many users. Will be fixed before the next
          release.
        </li>
          <li>
          Normal: If this issue scratches the itch of any particular developer, then
          they should help to solve it and provide a patch.
        </li>
          <li>
          Low: If this issue bothers you, then fix it because it is not a high priority
          for the project.

      <title>Some search filters</title>
      <p>
        Various general searches are available from the
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR">front page</a>, e.g.
        "open issues classified by component", or "Added recently". The
        following are some special filters.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=12310472">FOR-open-with-patch</a>
        - Committers need to visit this regularly and deal with the patches.
      </li>
        <li><a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=12310820">FOR-roadmap-dev</a>

        - Issues that have demonstrations of problems, but no solution or patch.
        Of course it will include FOR-open-with-patch.
        (Note that this filter searches for the string "attach" so will not find all.)
      </li>
        <li><a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=12310043">FOR-unscheduled</a>
