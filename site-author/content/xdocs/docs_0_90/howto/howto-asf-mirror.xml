    <title>Generate an ASF mirrors page using interactive web form</title>
    <abstract>
      Include html form elements into a forrest-generated html page. For
      example, this enables building automated download mirror pages for ASF
      project websites.

  <audience title="Intended Audience">
    <ul>
      <li>Any Apache project that uses Forrest to generate their website
        will need to have a mirrors page.</li>
      <li>Anyone interested in the use of embedding html form
        elements into a generated Forrest page.</li>
      <li>Anyone needing to add extra documents to the processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </audience>
  <purpose title="Purpose">
    <p>
      All Apache projects use dynamically generated download pages which
      determine the closest mirror and provide an interactive list of the
      current alternative mirrors. This HowTo describes the procedure to
      generate the template page that is utilised by the mirrors.cgi script.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mirrors.cgi and mirrors.html are "extra" documents, i.e. have no links
      from anywhere in the site. So we explain how to process additional files.
    </p>
  </purpose>
  <prerequisites title="Prerequisites">
    <ul>
      <li>Followed the documentation about
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/~bodewig/mirror.html">Making your
      downloads mirrorable</link> and
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/dev/mirrors.html">Apache Mirroring Information</link>
      .
      </li>
      <li>Established your ASF distribution space as described.</li>
      <li>Already building your project website with Forrest.</li>
    </ul>
  </prerequisites>
  <steps title="Steps">
    <p>
     See the example for the Apache Forrest website. The following files are involved:
    </p>
    <source>
$FORREST_HOME/site-author/content/xdocs/site.xml (search for "mirrors")
$FORREST_HOME/site-author/content/xdocs/mirrors.html
$FORREST_HOME/site-author/content/mirrors.cgi
$FORREST_HOME/site-author/conf/cli.xconf (search for "mirrors")
$FORREST_HOME/site-author/forrest.properties (search for "project.configfile")</source>
    <section id="cgi">
      <title>Add the mirrors.cgi as a raw file</title>
      <p>
        As explained in the mirrors document, there will be a two-line CGI
        wrapper script at the top-level of your website called
        <code>mirrors.cgi</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Utilising the Forrest concept of raw un-processed content, add the file
        as <code>src/documentation/mirrors.cgi</code> (copy the Forrest
        project's
        <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/site-author/content/mirrors.cgi">mirrors.cgi</link>)
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="html">
      <title>Add the mirrors.html to xdocs directory</title>
      <p>
        This file contains the html content of your mirror page, including the
        html form elements which drive the mirror selection. It also contains
        the specific tokens that are interpreted by the mirrors.cgi script to
        add the list of mirrors and select the closest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add the file as <code>src/documentation/xdocs/mirrors.html</code> (Use
        the Forrest project's
        <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/site-author/content/xdocs/mirrors.html">mirrors.html</link>
        as a template and edit it to suit.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the special tokens (e.g. [if-any http] [for http]) need to be
        encompassed by xml comments.

      <title>Cause the mirrors.html to be processed as an extra file</title>
      <p>
        Forrest gathers the links that are to be crawled, by reading site.xml
        and by finding any other internal links in the actual documents. There
        is no link to mirrors.html because it is an extra file that needs to be
        generated and skinned, but not linked in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cocoon command-line interface
        (<link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/offline/">CLI</link>)
        to the rescue. Add the following entry to your project's cli.xconf file.
        See the FAQ about adding and configuring a project-based

      <note>
        Due to Issue
        <link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-480">FOR-480</link>
        the generated mirrors.html will end up in forrest/main/site/mirrors.html
        rather than in the project's build directory. So use the following workaround
        in your cli.xconf file ...
      </note>
      <p>
        This example comes from $FORREST_HOME/site-author/conf/cli.xconf file.
        The path is relative to $FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/ directory. A full
        pathname should also work.

        The mirrors.html has special URIs which are processed by the mirrors CGI script.
