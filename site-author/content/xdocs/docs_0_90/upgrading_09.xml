        This is the <strong>development</strong> version of Apache Forrest.
        Developers can obtain it from the <a href="site:version-control">Subversion</a>
        repository.
        See the notes for obtaining and <a href="site:build">Building
        Forrest</a>.
      </note>
      <p>
        This page describes some changes to Apache Forrest that affect people
        who are upgrading to the 0.9 version. If you have other issues, then
        please discuss on either the
        <a href="site:mail-lists/forrest-dev">dev</a> or

      <title>Notes about Cocoon version</title>
      <p>
        Our packaged version of Apache Cocoon has been upgraded to use the
        latest version of their stable 2.1 branch. This is a major step forward
        for Forrest. It enables us to use a reliable and up-to-date Cocoon.
        Forrest developers can again participate at Cocoon to fix issues or
        develop new blocks. A number of major performance issues are already
        fixed in this version.
      </p>
      <p>
        In previous versions of Forrest we were using a development version of
        Cocoon trunk (i.e. 2.2). A number of things happened which caused us to
        fall out of synchronisation with Cocoon. They started using Maven as a
        build system, which took a long time to settle down. In turn that meant
        that Apache Gump could not perform continuous integration, which shut
        Forrest off. At the same time Cocoon trunk was making technical advances
        which changed some of the ways that Forrest interacts with Cocoon. In
        particular the command-line interface which Forrest uses to build a
        complete static site.
        See other notes via <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1017">FOR-1017</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon-2.1 is closer to our stalled version of Cocoon-2.2 than the
        current head of Cocoon-2.2 trunk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this move does not preclude us from future updates to other
        versions of Cocoon or even to another xml processing framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to use your own version of Cocoon-2.1, for example to add
        another Cocoon Block or to enhance a particular existing block, then
        see the notes in the <code>$FORREST_HOME/etc/cocoon_upgrade</code>
        directory.

        <title>Cocoon upgrade issues</title>
        <p>
          There are only two minor issues for those upgrading from the previous
          version of Forrest:
        </p>
        <p>
          When you first use this in your existing projects, there will probably
          be a message about a certain cache item. On the second run all is well.
          A way to avoid that would be to do 'forrest clean-work' in each of
          your projects to remove the old Cocoon cache.
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
          The configuration file is now at
          <code>main/webapp/WEB-INF/cocoon.xconf</code>
        </p>
          Our previous version of Cocoon had a facility called "Running modes"
          which enabled one set of a minimal group of properties for development
          and a different set for production. This is not available in Cocoon-2.1
          version. If you were using this feature, then simply move your defined
          properties into the <code>main/webapp/WEB-INF/properties/core.properties</code>
          file.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="missing-symbols">
      <title>Missing project symbols file in some projects</title>
      <p>Users of 0.8, and developers with older 0.9-dev, who based their sites on 'forrest seed-basic' rather than 'forrest seed-sample' will be affected by <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1075">FOR-1075</a>. There was a partially implemented xml catalog with missing symbols file.
      </p>
      <p>
        You would get the message:
      </p>
      <source>Failed to create InputSource (java.io.FileNotFoundException:
.../src/documentation/resources/schema/symbols-project-v10.ent
(No such file or directory)...</source>
      <p>
        This is just a warning message from the misconfigured xml entity catalog.
        To silence it, simply copy the file from a new "seed-basic" site,
        or more directly by
        <code>cp $FORREST_HOME/main/fresh-site/src/documentation/resources/schema/symbols-project-v10.ent $PROJECT/src/documentation/resources/schema/symbols-project-v10.ent</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        This "project symbols" ability using xml entities is useful in two ways.
        To provide common symbols, words, and phrases, in your source documents
        (added in v0.8 - <a href="site:faq/xml-entities">FAQ</a>).
        To configure some Cocoon sitemap components
        (added in v0.9 - <a href="site:faq/sitemap-entities">FAQ</a>).

    <section id="docs">
      <title>Notes about documentation</title>
      <p>
        After each release, the "Versioned Docs" are copied to form the new
        "dev" set. Ideally the docs are then upgraded in readiness for the new
        release. This has not been completed for recent releases. In particular
        there are example snippets of sitemaps which have not yet been upgraded
        to reflect the changes to the sitemaps and the separation of some core
        stuff into plugins. See issues
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-546">FOR-546</a> and
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-922">FOR-922</a> and
        others.

      <title>General upgrade tips</title>
      <p>
        Synchronise your project's skinconf.xml and forrest.properties files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take advantage of the separation of concerns. In a new workspace, create
        a fresh '<code>forrest seed</code>' site, then tweak its
        forrest.properties and skinconf.xml until it reflects your old site.
        When it is ready, replace your project's skinconf.xml and
        forrest.properties files. Any remaining issues would concern other
        aspects of your configuration, such as site.xml and your actual content.
      </p>

    <section id="project-sitemap">
      <title>Remove project sitemap if not necessary</title>
      <p>
        It has come to our attention that some people have a
        <a href="site:project-sitemap">project sitemap</a>
        even though they are not using it. Such un-necessary sitemaps should be
        removed to avoid maintenance issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do use a project sitemap, then pay attention to the 0.8 upgrade
        instructions "<a href="site:upgrading_08">Forrest configuration simplification</a>".
