      <note>
        This is the <strong>development</strong> version of Apache Forrest.
        Developers can obtain it from the <a href="site:version-control">Subversion</a>
        repository.
        See the notes for obtaining and <a href="site:build">Building
        Forrest</a>.
      </note>
      <p>This is a placeholder document for the new version.</p>
<!-- FIXME: need to bring back some sections from the 0.8 version, temporarily removed -->

      <title>Missing project symbols file in some projects</title>
      <p>Users of 0.8, and developers with older 0.9-dev, who based their sites on 'forrest seed-basic' rather than 'forrest seed-sample' will be affected by FOR-1075. There was a partially implemented xml catalog with missing symbols file.
      </p>
      <p>
        You would get the message:
      </p>
      <source>Failed to create InputSource (java.io.FileNotFoundException:
.../src/documentation/resources/schema/symbols-project-v10.ent
(No such file or directory)...</source>
      <p>
        This is just a warning message from the misconfigured xml entity catalog.
        To silence it, simply copy the file from a new "seed-basic" site,
        or more directly by
        <code>cp $FORREST_HOME/main/fresh-site/src/documentation/resources/schema/symbols-project-v10.ent $PROJECT/src/documentation/resources/schema/symbols-project-v10.ent</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        This "project symbols" ability using xml entities is useful in two ways. 
        To provide commons symbols, words, and phrases, in your source documents
        (added in v0.8 - <a href="site:faq/xml-entities">FAQ</a>).
        To configure some Cocoon sitemap components
        (added in v0.9 - <a href="site:faq/sitemap-entities">FAQ</a>).
