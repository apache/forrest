    <title>Status of Themes: Skins and Dispatcher</title>

      <title>Skins</title>
      <p>
        "Skins" is the term used to describe the current method for adding
        navigation and menu information to the content of a page and applying a
        consistent theme for layout, colours, etc. The
        <a 
        href="site:skins">"pelt" skin</a> is the only one that the
        Forrest project is maintaining. It is configurable enough to meet many
        purposes. The main configuration file for skins is the skinconf.xml
        file. There is an ability for users to create their own skins, although
        we have not encouraged that.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Forrest-0.9 release, skins are still available and are still the
        main mechanism.

      <title>Dispatcher</title>
      <p>
        "Dispatcher" is the term used to describe a new method which aims to be
        a more flexible and complete solution to build a reliable common
        structure for documents, incorporate other content, and provide hooks
        for applying themes. Themes get configured by structurer definitions (a
        wee bit like the skinconf.xml). Although strong progress has been made,
        it is still under development. We encourage developers to use Dispatcher
        and contribute to its development. See its own documentation in the trunk whiteboard plugins.

      <title>Plan for future framework</title>
      <p>
        The desired direction is to use xhtml2 as the internal format, move the
        current "skins" into a plugin, and develop input plugins for xdoc and
        html sources. This would enable any theme engine to be used, whether
        that be Skins or Dispatcher or some other.

        status of skins and dispatcher</a>. This is planned for immediately
        following the 0.8 release. New developers please help.
