    <title>Apache Forrest documentation</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      A good place to get started in our docs is the
      <a href="site:your-project">Using Forrest</a> guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some <a href="site:upgrading_09">upgrading notes</a> for people
      updating from previous versions of Forrest, along with summaries of some
      new features.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <a href="site:howto/overview">How-To</a> section you will find various
      practical guides on how to achieve common objectives in Forrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also have a <a href="site:faq">FAQ</a> list that you should consult
      before posting questions to our user list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The documentation <a href="site:linkmap">Table of Contents</a> provides a
      useful overview of the main documentation. This <a href="site:faq/docs">FAQ</a>
      explains that there is other documentation at the example forrest
      seed site and that each plugin has its own documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are docs for <a href="site:versions/overview">other versions</a>
      too.
