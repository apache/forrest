    <title>Apache Forrest: documentation framework</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      Apache Forrest
      (<a href="site:forrest">forrest.apache.org</a>)
       is an XML standards-oriented documentation framework
      based upon Apache Cocoon, providing XSLT stylesheets and schemas,
      images and other resources. Forrest uses these to render the source
      content into various output formats via command-line, robot, or
      dynamic application.
    </p>
    <p>
      By <strong>separating content from
      presentation</strong>, providing <strong>content templates</strong>
      and <strong>pre-written skins</strong>, Forrest is unequalled at enabling
      content producers to get their message out fast.  This separation of
      concerns makes Forrest excellent
      to publish <strong>project documentation</strong> (notably software projects),
      <strong>intranets</strong>, and <strong>home pages</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forrest is
      built on one of the world's leading XML application frameworks, 
      <a href="ext:cocoon">Apache Cocoon</a>, which provides advanced
      users with extremely powerful publishing capabilities.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple task-specific source XML formats can be used
       (<a href="site:howto">How-To</a>,
        <a href="site:faq"><acronym title="Frequently Asked
            Questions">FAQ</acronym></a>,
        <a href="site:changes">changelogs</a> and
        <a href="site:todo">todo lists</a> supported natively).
        Source formats include: Apache xdocs xml format, plain html
        documents, some Wiki formats, a subset of DocBook, ...
      </li>
      <li>Multiple output formats supported, for example HTML and PDF (using
        <a href="ext:fop">Apache FOP</a>).
      </li>
      <li>SVG to PNG rendering (using <a href="ext:batik">Apache
        Batik</a>). Simply drop the SVG in the appropriate directory
        and it will be rendered as PNG.</li>
      <li>
        Transparent inclusion and aggregation of external content, like
        <a href="site:changes-rss">RSS feeds</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anything else possible with the
        <a href="ext:cocoon/sitemap">Cocoon sitemap</a>.  Using database
        queries, <a href="ext:apache-stats">charting</a>, web services
        integration; the possibilities are constantly growing as Cocoon grows.
        See the <a href="ext:cocoon/features">Cocoon Features</a> list
        for the full suite of capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Based on Java, Forrest is platform-independent, making for a
        documentation system that is just as portable as the XML data it
        processes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your development team does not need Java experience, or even XML
        skills, to use Forrest. The framework lets you concentrate on
        content and design.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unique amongst comparable documentation tools, Forrest generates
      sites that can run both <strong>interactively</strong> as a dynamic
      web application, or as statically rendered pages.
      Running as a webapp has a major advantage during development:
      content can be written, and
      then the rendered output viewed almost instantly in a web browser.
      This <a href="site:your-project/webapp">webapp technique</a>
      enables the edit/review cycle to be faster than command-line
      transformation tools.
