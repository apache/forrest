    <title>The document-v1.1 DTD</title>
    <notice>This document doesn't make any sense at all.</notice>
    <abstract>
      A nonsense document using all possible elements in the current
      <code>document-v11.dtd</code>.
    </abstract>
  </header>
  <body>
    <note>
      document-v11 has been superceded by
      <link
        href="site:document-v12">document-v12</link>
    </note>
    <p>
      This is a simple paragraph. Most documents contain a fair amount of
      paragraphs. Paragraphs are called <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p xml:space="preserve">
      With the <code>&lt;p xml:space="preserve"&gt;</code> attribute, you can declare
      that whitespace should    be   preserved, without implying it is in any other
      way special.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of in-line elements are available in the DTD, we will show them
      inside an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Here is a simple list item (<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>).</li>
      <li>Have you seen the use of the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element in the
        previous item?</li>
      <li>Also, we have <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>
        elements to show content <sup>above</sup> or <sub>below</sub> the text
        baseline.</li>
      <li>There is a facility to <em>emphasize</em> certain words using the
        <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element.</li>
      <li>We can use
        <icon height="22" width="26" src="images/icon.png" alt="feather"/><code>&lt;icon&gt;</code>s, too.</li>
      <li>Another possibility is the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element:
        <img src="images/icon.png" alt="another feather" height="22" width="26"/>,
        which offers the ability to refer to an image map.</li>
      <li>We have elements for hyperlinking: 
        <dl>
          <dt><code>&lt;link href="your-project.html"&gt;</code></dt>
          <dd>Use this to
            <link href="your-project.html" title="Example of a document via link">link</link>
           to another document. As per normal, this will open the new document
           in the same browser window.</dd>
          <dt><code>&lt;link href="#section"&gt;</code></dt>
          <dd>Use this to
            <link href="#section" title="Example of a document via local anchor">link</link>
           to the named anchor in the current document.
          </dd>
          <dt><code>&lt;link href="your-project.html#images"&gt;</code></dt>
          <dd>Use this to
            <link href="your-project.html#images" title="Example of a document via link and anchor">link</link>
           to another document and go to the named anchor. This will open
           the new document in the same browser window.
          </dd>
          <dt><code>&lt;jump href="your-project.html"&gt;</code></dt>
          <dd>Use this to
            <jump href="your-project.html" title="Example of a document via jump">jump</jump>
           to another document and optionally go to a named
            <jump href="your-project.html#images" title="Example of a document via jump to anchor">anchor</jump>
           within that document. This will open the new document in the same
           browser window. So what is the difference between link and jump?
           The jump behaves differently, in that it will replace any frames
           in the current window.
           This is the equivalent of
           <code>&lt;a ... target="_top"&gt;</code></dd>
          <dt><code>&lt;fork href="your-project.html"&gt;</code></dt>
          <dd>Use this to
            <fork href="your-project.html" title="Example of a document via fork">fork</fork>
           your webbrowser to another document. This will open the document
           in a new, unnamed browser window.
           This is the equivalent of
           <code>&lt;a ... target="_blank"&gt;</code></dd>
        </dl></li>
      <li>Oh, by the way, a definition list <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> was used inside
   the previous list item. We could put another 
    <ul>
          <li>unordered list</li>
          <li>inside the list item</li>
        </ul> too, but I believe this liberty gets quickly quite hairy as you
    see.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So far for the in-line elements, let's look at some paragraph-level
      elements.
    </p>
    <fixme author="SN">
      The <code>&lt;fixme&gt;</code> element is used for stuff which still needs
      work. Mind the <code>author</code> attribute!
    </fixme>
    <note>
      Use the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element to draw attention to something,
      e.g. ...The <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element is used when the author
      can't express himself clearly using normal sentences ;-)
    </note>
    <warning>
      Sleep deprivation can be the result of being involved in an open source
      project. (a.k.a. the <code>&lt;warning&gt;</code> element).
    </warning>
    <p>
      Apart from unordered lists, we have ordered lists too, of course.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>This should be 3 if my math is still OK.</li>
    </ol>
    <anchor id="section"/>
    <section>
      <title>Using sections</title>
      <p>
        You can use sections to put some structure in your document. For some
        strange historical reason, the section title is an attribute of the
        <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Sections, the sequel</title>
      <p>
        Just some second section.
      </p>
      <section>
        <title>Section 2.1</title>
        <p>
          Which contains a subsection (2.1).
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <anchor id="source"/>
    <section>
      <title>Showing preformatted source code</title>
      <p>
        Enough about these sections. Let's have a look at more interesting
        elements, <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> for instance:
      </p>
      <source>// This example is from the book _Java in a Nutshell_ by David Flanagan.

import java.applet.*;    // Don't forget these import statements!
import java.awt.*;

public class FirstApplet extends Applet {
    // This method displays the applet.
    // The Graphics class is how you do all drawing in Java.
    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        g.drawString("Hello World", 25, 50);
    }
}</source>
      <p>
        Please take care to still use a sensible line-length within your source
        elements.
      </p>
    </section>
    <anchor id="table"/>
    <section>
      <title>Using tables</title>
      <p>
        And now for a table:
      </p>
      <table>
        <caption>Table caption</caption>
        <tr>
          <th>heading cell</th>
          <th>heading cell</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>data cell</td>
          <td>data cell</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        Not much of attributes with <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, if you ask me.
      </p>
    </section>
    <anchor id="figure"/>
    <section>
      <title>Using figures</title>
      <p>
        And a figure to end all of this.
      </p>
      <figure src="images/project-logo2.png" alt="The fine Forrest logo" width="220" height="65"/>
