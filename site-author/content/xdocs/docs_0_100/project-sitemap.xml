      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        After Forrest 0.6 it is now possible for projects to intercept the core
        sitemaps, without needing to copy the main sitemaps and keep them
        synchonised. This will enable hassle-free update to future Forrest
        versions.
      </p>
      <note>
        We advise you to spend time to understand the Apache Cocoon sitemap. See
        <link href="ext:cocoon/sitemap">Cocoon sitemap</link> and
        <link href="ext:cocoon/concepts">Cocoon concepts</link> and related
        component documentation. The Forrest sitemap is broken into multiple
        files. The main one is <strong>sitemap.xmap</strong> which delegates to
        others. See the <link href="site:sitemap-ref">Sitemap Reference</link>
        for a tour of the default sitemap.
      </note>

    <section id="how">
      <title>How does it work?</title>
      <p>
        If a project has a <code>sitemap.xmap</code> file in it's documentation
        dir, that gets mounted automatically by Forrest and becomes part of the
        processing: it is a preprocessing step, and is the first one to handle
        the request. Because of this it can serve any file directly. If it does
        not want to serve a file, it can simply not match the URL and Forrest
        will take care of it as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cool thing is that if that pipeline serves an xml representation,
        Forrest will provide a skinned version of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if the project sitemap matches test.xml and transforms that to a
        correctly structured Forrest intermediate "document-v*", then the user
        will see test.html fully rendered by Forrest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, to resolve the directories in your sitemap it is important to
        use the 'project:' and 'forrest:' variables to prevent any possible
        issue in the future.
