        There are various ways for your project to provide additional
        JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets.
        The chosen <a href="site:skins">skin</a> already provides many.
        Your project can supplement that, and provide additional capabilities
        for your whole site or for specific pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the new Dispatcher capability provides its own more powerful techniques.
        See <a href="site:status-themes">Status of Themes: Skins and Dispatcher</a>.
        Still, some of the techniques described below are relevant.

          The "link" and "script" elements can be added to the head section of
          your source xml or source html documents.
          The project sitemap can add a Transformer to inject additional
          elements to the internal xml.
          The "Content Aware Pipelines" can detect certain documents to apply such.
          The sitemaps and locationmaps resolve the linked resources by searching
          through a set of known locations in your project.
