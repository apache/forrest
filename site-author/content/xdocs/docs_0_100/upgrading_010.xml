      <note>
        This is the <strong>development</strong> version of Apache Forrest.
        Developers can obtain it from the <a href="site:version-control">Subversion</a>
        repository.
        See the instructions for obtaining and <a href="site:build">Building
        Forrest</a>.
        This Note will go away when the release candidate is packed.
        Until then see the release notes in preparation (which extracts the
        importance=high elements from the changes list).
        In <code>site-author</code>
        do <code>http://localhost:8888/releaseNotes_current.txt</code>
      </note>
      <p>
        This page describes some changes to Apache Forrest that affect people
        who are upgrading to the 0.10-dev version. If you have other issues, then
        please discuss on either the
        <a href="site:mail-lists/forrest-dev">dev</a> or
        <a href="site:mail-lists/forrest-user">user</a> mailing lists. As more
        experience is gained, this document will be updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        (If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.9 then you will need to
        see the notes for the previous upgrade.)

      <title>New Features</title>
      <p>
        The following list shows some of the key new features.
        See also the <code>RELEASE-NOTES</code> document that was provided with
        the release package. For the full list
        of changes, see the main <a href="site:changes">change log</a> and also
        for each plugin.

        Some new initial plugins are in the "whiteboard". See the entries in the
        <a href="site:changes">change log</a> and see each plugin's
        documentation and changes log. This includes the new Dispatcher. See
        <a href="site:status-themes">Status of Themes: Skins and Dispatcher</a>.

      <title>Notes about documentation</title>
      <p>
        After each release, the "Versioned Docs" are copied to form the new
        "dev" set. Ideally the docs are then upgraded in readiness for the new
        release. This has not been completed for recent releases. In particular
        there are example snippets of sitemaps which have not yet been upgraded
        to reflect the changes to the sitemaps and the separation of some core
        stuff into plugins. See issues
        <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-546">FOR-546</a> and
        <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-922">FOR-922</a> and
        others.

      <title>General upgrade tips</title>
      <p>
        Compare your configuration with that of a fresh seed site.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, synchronise your project's skinconf.xml and forrest.properties files:
      </p>
      <p>
        Take advantage of the separation of concerns. In a new workspace, create
        a fresh '<code>forrest seed</code>' site, then tweak its
        forrest.properties and skinconf.xml until it reflects your old site.
        When it is ready, replace your project's skinconf.xml and
        forrest.properties files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other configuration files should also be synchronised with the default
        files which you copied. For example, a project
        Catalog Entity Resolver or symbols entities (see
        <a href="ext:forrest-zone/seed/xml-entities">notes</a>).
        Other potentional files that you might be using are:
        the Apache Cocoon 
        <a href="site:faq/cli-xconf">cli.xconf</a>
        file to control Cocoon (for example to include/exclude some URIs);
        the Jetty server
        <a href="site:faq/run_port">configuration</a>
        file (for example to do 'forrest run' on a different port)
        ; etcetera.
        You might also have a necessary
        <a href="#project-sitemap">project sitemap</a> (see next section).
      </p>
      <p>
        Any remaining issues should concern other
        aspects of your configuration, such as site.xml and your actual content.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="project-sitemap">
      <title>Remove project sitemap if not necessary</title>
      <p>
        It has come to our attention that some people have a
        <a href="site:project-sitemap">project sitemap</a>
        even though they are not using it. Such un-necessary sitemaps should be
        removed to avoid maintenance issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do use a project sitemap, then pay attention to the 0.8 upgrade
        instructions "<a href="site:upgrading_08">Forrest configuration simplification</a>".
