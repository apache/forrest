        Skins are standard zip archives with a *.zip extension. This enables
        them to be unpacked and installed automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        To publish a skin:
      </p>
      <source>
1 - forrest package-skin
The skin package will be made in the skin dir, next to the custom skin.
2 - place the file in a directory on a web server
3 - ask forrest-dev to add the url and the skin name to the list of skins
</source>
      <p>
        To use a custom skin with automatic download:
      </p>
      <source>
1 - set the skin property in forrest.properties to the name of the skin
2 - forrest install-skin
3 - forrest
</source>
      <p>
        Currently there are two test skins: "testskin" and "testskin2"
      </p>
      <p>
        To see the names of the remote skins:
      </p>

        The skin will get blown away by the next 'build clean' in forrest. But
        that is okay because it is so quick to go get another copy. Also it may
        be preferable to get a fresh copy. If the user wanted to keep the skin
        and perhaps enhance it, then they can copy it to their project.
