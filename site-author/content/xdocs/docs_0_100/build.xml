          FAQ</a>.
        </note>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure you have a recent release of a
           <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow">Subversion</a>
           client installed and properly configured.</li>
          <li>Read the ASF notes about source repositories and
           <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">version control</a>
           and see Forrest's developer notes about our
           <a href="site:version-control">SVN</a>.
          </li>
          <li>At a command prompt, enter
           '<code>svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk forrest</code>'
           (committers should replace <code>http</code> with <code>https</code>).</li>
          <li>This will create a directory called "<code>forrest</code>" where the Forrest source will be stored.</li>
          <li>Pay attention to README.txt and LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Whenever you want to update your Forrest source tree to the current
          version, change to the top-level "<code>forrest</code>" directory and
          invoke '<code>svn update</code>'.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see what changes you've made, invoke '<code>svn status</code>'
        </p>
        <p>
          SVN is really powerful. See
          <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" rel="nofollow">Version Control with
          Subversion</a> - the opensource SVN book.

      <section id="release">
        <title>Sources are also available in the release</title>
        <p>
          Each release of forrest contains a copy of all sources as at the time
          of the release. So the building instructions below do apply to that.
          Of course the svn method described above will provide the most up-to-date
          version for developers.

      <title>Building and installing Forrest</title>
      <note>
        This document applies to this specific version. See other
        instructions for the 
        <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/docs/dev/build.html">development</a>
        version.
      </note>
      <p>
        To build Forrest, change directory to '<code>forrest/main</code>', and
        then type '<code>build</code>' on Windows or '<code>./build.sh</code>'
        on Unix. (Requires Java 1.5) If everything is successful, you should see
        a message similar to:
      </p>
      <source>
  *-----------------------------------------------------------------
  | Installation notice
  *-----------------------------------------------------------------
  | You have built the X.Y-dev version of Forrest.
  | Please set the environment variable FORREST_HOME point to
  |  /svn/forrest
  | It is recommended to add
  |    unix: $FORREST_HOME/bin: to your $PATH
  |    win: %FORREST_HOME%\bin; to your %PATH%
  | Then do 'forrest -projecthelp' to list options for the 'forrest' command
  | More help at http://forrest.apache.org/
  *-----------------------------------------------------------------
     </source>
      <p>
        As the message says, you need to add the distribution's
        <code>bin/</code> ("binary") directory to your PATH variable, so the
        <code>'forrest'</code> command is available everywhere:
      </p>
      <source>
[~]$ cd /path/to/svn/forrest
[/svn/forrest]$ export FORREST_HOME=`pwd`
[/svn/forrest]$ export PATH=$PATH:$FORREST_HOME/bin
     </source>
      <warning>
        After updating the Forrest source from SVN, if there have been certain
        types of updates (e.g. Java sources, supporting libraries, build system,
        etc.) you will need to clean and build forrest again. Do 'cd
        forrest/main; build clean; build".
      </warning>
    </section>
    <section id="run">
      <title>Run Forrest, run!</title>
      <p>
        Forrest is now ready to go. To view and edit the local copy of Forrest
        core documentation, cd to site-author and do '<code>forrest run</code>'
        to see the local webapp using the bundled Jetty server. Edit something
        in content/xdocs/*.xml see the immediate effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The document <a href="site:your-project">Using Forrest</a> is your
        next step.
