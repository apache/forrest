    <warning>
      This is a document written whilst testing the Gobby software. It is

      choice of communication media for Forrest Tuesdays, we still use IRC at
      this time.

  </audience>
  <purpose title="Purpose">
    <p>
      On the first Tuesday of each month we have a 24-hour get-together using
      the dev mailing list, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and other collaborative
      tools, to work on Forrest development and get to know each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We exploring the use of a <a href="http://gobby.0x539.de">Gobby</a>, a
      collaborative editor, to assist in focused development tasks. This HowTo
      will show you how.
    </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <em> Gobby is a free collaborative editor based on libobby, a library
          which provides synced document buffers. It supports multiple documents
          in one session and a multi-user chat. It runs on Microsoft Windows,
          Mac OS X, Linux and other Unix-like platforms. </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see some of its
          <a href="http://gobby.0x539.de/features.html">features</a>. People
          interested in the technical details of how Gobby works should read
          <a href="http://darcs.0x539.de/trac/obby/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/ObbyInternals">this

        <title>Installing Required Software</title>
        <p class="instruction">
          Download Gooby from Gobby's web site
          (http://gobby.0x539.de/download.html). If you use one of the popular
          Linux distributions, chances are that Gobby is already available as a
          binary package for you. Debian/Ubuntu users, for instance, can simply
          <code>apt-get install gobby</code>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="session">
        <title>Creating a Collaborative Session</title>
        <p>
          When you first fire up Gobby, you will be presented with a blank
          screen with a toolbar on the top. Click on "Create Session" to host a
          session. If you need to join an existing session, click "Join session"
          instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a session, you need a computer connected to the Internet and
          you need to know its IP address. On Linux, this can be obtained with a
          <code>ifconfig -a</code>. On windows, try doing <code>ipcongfig
          /all</code>. For most cases, leaving the port values at default should
          be sufficient. Once you have specified the IP address and the name of
          the session, click "Create".
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an early version of a server available for Gobby. This allows
          you to run a (semi-)permanent server. It is currently only available
          for linux.

        <title>Logging in to the session</title>
        <p>
          To join a Gobby session, click on "Join session" on the toolbar. You
          will need to know the IP address of the machine the session is being
          hosted at. In the "Name" field, just put in your name. Choose a color
          (which you can change later) and click OK. You will then be prompted
          for the session password before joining.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you first enter the Gobby session, if a document is already open,
          you will be informed the document exists but that you are not
          currently subscribed to it. There will be a "Subscribe" button below
          this notice that will give you access to the document once clicked.
          Documents that are created or opened during the session will also need
          to be subscribed to in a similar manner.

        <title>Using Chat for Discussion</title>
        <p>
          Gobby has a chat session at the bottom of the window. This can be used
          to discuss what needs to be done and who is going to be doing it. Here
          is an (edited) chat session log from when this document was written.

        <title>Using Gobby for Collaborative Authoring</title>
        <p>
          Gobby uses colors to identify the edits being done by participants. In
          order to make it easier to follow whats going on, its a good idea to
          choose visibly distinct colors. While joining a session, if you choose
          a color thats already in use by someone else, Gobby will refuse to
          connect to the session. Just choose some color that gets you in,
          because you can always change your color later on while a session is
          in progress (see "Set Color" under the "User" menu item).
        </p>
        <warning>
          If you close a document it closes for everyone, and remote users are
          not given the option to save any changes. So think carefully before
          closing anything. Generally speaking you should not close a document
          without asking all participants first.

      <section id="closingSession">
        <title>Closing the Session</title>
        <p>
          To close, or leave a session, simply click on the "Quit Session"
          button in the toolbar. Be sure to save the files before doing so,
          especially if you "own" the file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the host must be careful not to quit the session until all
          participants ahve finished their work. It is a good idea to use chat
          to ensure everyone is done, alternatively, you could leave the session
          open until everyone else has quit.
        </p>
        <warning>
          With the current version of Gobby (0.2.2) if any user leaves a session
          the document is closed in all remaining users sessions. Any unsaved
          changes are lost. Do not leave a session without agreeing to do so
          with all other participants.

        <note>
          At this point, we're not very sure if Gobby stores the chat logs
          somewhere on disk (we were not able to locate them). If you know the
          location of the logs, please let us know.

        <title>Committing Documents to SVN</title>
        <p>
          Any user can save a copy of a file being edited locally. However, it
          is recomended that someone be nominated as the person responsible for
          committing the file to SVN at the end of the session.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned before, the person responsible for committing should make
          sure that the document is properly formatted before committing.

        <answer>
          <p>
            The goal of a How-To is to help the reader to accomplish a specific
            task with clear and consise instructions. While tutorials may
            contain How-To-like instructions and content, they also include
            additional background and conceptual content to help teach their
            readers higher order concepts along the way. How-Tos are concerned
            about filling an immediate, short-term need. Tutorials often provide
            long-term knowledge which can be applied across a range of needs.

        <question>What coding convention should I follow?</question>
        <answer>
          <p>
            Gobby is a good collaborative editor, but not a very good editor. It
            allows minimalistic configuration flexibility for editing. For Gobby
            sessions, it is sufficient to choose a convention and stick with it.
            For instance, using 4 spaces for a tab indent, and using spaces to
            fill up the tabs -- this can be done through the "Preferences" item
            under the "Edit" menu.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nominated committer should make sure that the document is
            properly formatted before committing to SVN.
          </p>
          <note>
            The current version of Gobby is 0.2.2, hopefully the editor will
            improve.

          A quick way to see if someone is currently working on a document is to
          look at the revision number in the status bar. This number will

          The text entry widget (where you type for chat) can show you an
          editable history of your previous entries by hitting the up arrow on
          your keyboard. This functions much like the up arrow key in a Linux
