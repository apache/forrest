    <faq id="requirements">
      <question>
        What are the system requirements for Forrest?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Forrest includes everything necessary to build and run, except
          of course for Java. In addition to all the Cocoon JARs, Forrest
          includes and uses its own version of Ant. Java 1.4+ is required.

    <faq id="maxmemory">
      <question>
        How can I specify the amount of memory to be used by Java?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
         There are two ways to control this.  If you get an OutOfMemoryError when Cocoon is generating pages,
         see the first paragraph.  If you get an OutOfMemoryError when outside of Cocoon (e.g., copying raw
         files), see the second paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
         The <code>maxmemory</code> property in the <code>forrest.properties</code> file controls how much
         memory Cocoon uses. Like many other properties you can copy them from the default configuration at
         <code>src/core/fresh-site/forrest.properties</code>
        </p>
        <p>
         Set the <code>ANT_OPTS</code> environment variable before you run forrest.  The exact value you set
         it to is dependant on your JVM, but something like <code>ANT_OPTS=-Xmx500M</code> will probably work.

  <part id="content_faqs">
    <title>Content Creation</title><faq id="edit-content">
      <question>What tools can be used to edit the content?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>If you are using the Apache Forrest xml
          <link href="site:dtd-docs">document format</link> or DocBook
          or other xml document types, then you can use any text editor
          or even a dedicated xml editor. You must ensure valid xml. See our
          <link href="site:catalog">configuration notes</link>
          for various editors.
        </p>
        <p>There are content management systems like
         <link href="ext:lenya">Apache Lenya</link>.
        </p>
        <p>Remember that Forrest can also use other source formats, such as
          OpenOffice.org docs or JSPWiki. Use the appropriate editor for those
          document types and ensure that the document stucture is consistent.
          Forrest can also use "html" as the source format, in which case you
          can use text editors or "html editors" such as the one provided
          with the Mozilla web browser.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </faq><faq id="PDF-output">
      <question>How can I generate one pdf-file out of
      the whole site or selected pages of the site?</question>
      <answer>
      <p>Add the following entries to your site.xml file:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[
  <about tab="home" label="About" href="">
 	  ...
    <all_site label="Full HTML" href="wholesite.html"/>    
    <all_sitePDF label="Full PDF" href="wholesite.pdf"/>  
     ...
  </about>]]></source>
       <p>
       In this case the menu labeled "About" will have 2 new items: 
       "Full PDF" and "Full HTML". (See also
       <link href="site:howto/pdf-tab">How to create a PDF document for each tab</link>.)
       </p>
       <p>
         This assumes that you use the
         <link href="site:linking">site.xml</link> method for your site
         structure and navigation, rather than the old book.xml method.

    <faq id="pageBreaks">
      <question>How do I insert page breaks into documents?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>Page breaks do not make a great deal of sense in HTML documents
        intended for display on a screen. However, PDF documents are intended
        for printing and therefore page breaks can be important.</p>
        <p>To insert a page break in a PDF document simply add 
        <em>pageBreakBefore</em> or <em>pageBreakAfter</em> to the class
        attribute of a section.</p>
        <p>If you want these classes to be processed in your HTML documents
        as well you should add the following to the <code>extra-css</code>
        element in your projects <code>skinconf.xml</code></p>
        <source>
        .pageBreakBefore {
          margin-bottom: 0;
          page-break-before: always;
        } 
        
        .pageBreakAfter {
          margin-bottom: 0;
          page-break-after: always;
        }
        </source>

    <faq id="clickable-email-address">
      <question>How can I generate html-pages to show a 
      'clickable' email-address (of the author-element)?</question>
       <answer>
       <p>You would override <code>
       $FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/skins/common/xslt/html/document2html.xsl</code>
       and edit the "headers/authors" template.

    </faq>

    <faq id="link_raw">
      <question>How do I link to raw files such as config.txt and brochure.pdf?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Place them in the <code>src/documentation/content</code> directory
          and they will get copied into the output tree where you can link to
          them. You can also have sub-directories there to reflect your xdocs
          tree. See the samples documents when you 'forrest seed' a new
          project for a demonstration of this ability.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, if
         <code>src/documentation/content/xdocs/tools/downloads.xml</code>
         has a <code>&lt;link href="tool.zip"&gt;</code> then put
         <code>tool.zip</code> in the
         <code>src/documentation/content/tools/</code> directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          See the explanation and demonstration of "linking" in your local
          'forrest seed' site.

    <faq id="pdf_images">
      <question>Images don't display in PDFs. How do I fix this?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
	  Forrest uses <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</link>
          for rendering PDFs.  FOP cannot handle all image types natively, and
          requires third-party jars to be added. FOP natively handles BMP, GIF,
	  JPG, TIFF and EPS (with a few limitations). FOP can also handle SVG
	  (via Batik!and PNG (see below). For details, see 
	  <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/graphics.html">FOP Graphics
          formats</link>
        </p>
        <p>To get PNGs working in PDFs with Jimi:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download Jimi from
           <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/">http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/</link></li>
          <li>Unpack the Jimi distribution and copy JimiProClasses.zip to
            <code>$FORREST/lib/optional/jimi-1.0.jar</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternatively you can use JAI (Java Advanced Imaging API at 
	  http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai). For more
          info, see
          <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/graphics.html#packages">FOP Graphics 
          Packages</link>

    <faq id="index.html">
      <question>
        The tab link in my site incorrectly assumes that 'index.html' is present in
        the linked-to directory. How do I fix this?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          In <code>tabs.xml</code>, use @href instead of @dir, and omit the
          trailing '/'. Which file to serve is then a concern of the sitemap.
          For example, if the "User Manual" tab should link to
          <code>manual/Introduction.html</code> then
          <code>tabs.xml</code> should contain:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
  <tab label="User Manual" href="manual"/>]]></source>
        <p>
          and add this rule to the sitemap:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
  <map:match pattern="manual">
    <map:redirect-to uri="manual/Introduction.html"/>
  </map:match>]]></source>

      <question>
        How to use special characters in the labels of the site.xml file?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        Use the numeric values for character entities.
        For example, rather than using
        <code><![CDATA[&ouml;]]></code> use
        <code><![CDATA[&#246;]]></code>
        </p>
        <p>

    <faq id="encoding">
      <question>Does Forrest handle accents for non-English languages?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>Yes, Forrest can process text in any language, so you can include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>accents: á é í ó ú</li>
          <li>diereses: ä ë ï ö ü</li>
          <li>tildes: ã ñ ĩ õ ũ</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is because sources for Forrest docs are xml documents, which can include any of these,
          provided the encoding declared by the xml doc matches the actual encoding used in the file.
          For example if you declare the default encoding:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>]]></source>
        <p>but the file content is actually using ISO-8859-1 then you will
           receive validation errors, especially if 
           you include some non-ASCII characters.</p>
        <p>
          This situation is commonly encountered when you edit the templates
          created by <code>forrest seed</code> with your favorite 
          (probably localized) editor without paying attention to the encoding,
          or when you create a new file 
          and simply copy the headers from another file.
        </p>
        <p>Although UTF-8 is an encoding well-suited for most languages,
          it is not usually the default in popular editors or systems.
          In UNIX-like systems, most popular editors can handle different encodings to 
          write the file in disk. With some editors the encoding of the file is preserved, while with others the default
          is used regardless of the original encoding. In most cases the encoding used to write files
          can be controlled by setting the environment variable <code>LANG</code>
          to an appropriate value, for instance:
        </p>
        <source>[localhost]$ export LANG=en_US.UTF-8</source>
        <p>Of course the <em>appropriate</em> way to set the encoding depends on the editor/OS, 
          but ultimately relys on the user preferences. So you can use the encoding you prefer, as long as 
          the <code>encoding</code> attribute of the xml declaration matches the actual encoding of the file. 
          This means 
          that if you are not willing to abandon ISO-8859-1 you can always use the following declaration instead:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>]]></source>
        <p>Another option is to use "character entities" such as
        <code><![CDATA[&ouml;]]></code> (&ouml;) or the numeric form
        <code><![CDATA[&#246;]]></code> (&#246;).
        </p>
        <p>Another related issue is that your webserver needs to send http
          headers with the matching charset definitions to the html page.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some references which explain further:

      <question>
        How do I stop Forrest breaking on links to external files that may not
        exist, like javadocs?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This can be done by overriding the <code>cli.xconf</code> config file,
          and defining patterns for URLs to exclude.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means creating a directory <code>src/documentation/conf</code>
          (or wherever <code>${forrest.conf-dir}</code> points) and copying
          <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cli.xconf</code> to it.
          Declare the location of this file in the forrest.properties
          configuration, e.g.
          <code>project.configfile=${project.home}/src/documentation/conf/cli.xconf</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then edit
          cli.xconf, and add any exclude sections that you require. The
          default cli.xconf ignores directory links and links containing
          'apidocs' or starting with 'api/':
        </p>

        <note>
          Wildcards may be used.  These are a powerful feature of Cocoon's

          For example, <strong>foo/*</strong> would match
          <code>foo/bar</code>, but not <code>foo/bar/baz</code>
           &mdash; use <strong>foo/**</strong> to match that.

      <question>Some of my files are not being processed because they use

      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Certain patterns are claimed by the default sitemaps for

          If you are using JDK 1.4.0 or newer, you can enable <em>headless</em>
          operation by running Forrest with the <code>forrest.jvmarg</code>
          parameter set to <code>-Djava.awt.headless=true</code>, like this:

    <faq id="breadcrumbs">
      <question>How do breadcrumbs work?  Why don't they work locally?</question>
      <answer>
      <p>Breadcrumbs begin with up to three URLs specified in
      <code>skinconf.xml</code>.  Here is what the Forrest site uses:</p>
      <source><![CDATA[
  <trail>
    <link1 name="apache" href="http://www.apache.org/"/>
    <link2 name="xml.apache" href="http://xml.apache.org/"/>
    <link3 name="" href=""/>
  </trail>]]></source>
      <p>If any links are blank, they are not used.  After these first links,
      JavaScript looks at the URL for the current page and
      makes a link for each directory after the domain.  If you are viewing
      the site locally, there is no domain and so
      there will be no extra breadcrumbs, only the ones that are specified
      in <code>skinconf.xml</code>.

          Certain patterns are claimed by the default sitemaps for

      <question>What is the relationship between &s; and

      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          One &s; file in your project root can replace all the book.xml files
          (one per directory) in your site.  Internally, Forrest uses &s; to
          dynamically generate book.xml files.  However, Forrest first checks
          for the existence of a book.xml file, so backwards-compatibility is
          preserved.  If a directory has a book.xml file, the book.xml will be
          used to generate the menu.  This supplement is useful in situations
          where &s;-generated menus aren't appropriate.

    <faq id="docbook">
      <question>
        How do I use DocBook as the xml documentation format?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
         There are two ways. Forrest has a <code>simplified-docbook</code> plugin
         which can transform the DocBook format into the
         Forrest "xdocs" format on-the-fly and then render that as normal
         Forrest documents.
         Be aware that the stylesheet that does this transformation is
         deliberately very limited and does not attempt to deal with all
         DocBook elements.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other way is to use the full DocBook stylesheets directly. The DocBook
         DTDs are shipped with Forrest and automatically handled. However, you
         will need to have the DocBook stylesheets on your system (they are
         too massive to ship with Forrest) and configure Forrest accordingly.
         You will need to create a
         <link href="site:project-sitemap">project sitemap</link>
          as explained in
         <link href="site:your-project">Using Forrest</link>
         and add matches to handle your DocBook documents.
         Here is an example. Note that you need to change it to suit your
         situation. The match must be very specific so that only the
         DocBook documents are matched. The rest of the documents will be
         handled by Forrest core. Powerful regex capabilities are available.
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0"?>
<map:sitemap xmlns:map="http://apache.org/cocoon/sitemap/1.0">
 <map:pipelines>

    <map:generate src="{project:content.xdocs}resolver-{1}.xml"/>
    <map:transform
      src="file:///usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets/xhtml/docbook.xsl"/>
    <map:serialize type="xhtml"/>
   </map:match>
  </map:pipeline>
 </map:pipelines>
</map:sitemap>]]>
        </source>
        <p>
         You can also use a mixture of the two methods, some handled
         automatically by Forrest and some directly using DocBook stylesheets.
         You can also have a mixture of source files as "document-v*" DTD and DocBook.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ensure that the document type declaration in your xml instance is
         well specified. Use a public identifier. The DTD will then be properly
         resolved by Forrest. If you need to use different DTDs, then see
         <link href="site:your-project/new_dtd">Using Forrest</link>

          The logfiles are at <code>build/webapp/WEB-INF/logs/</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          The log level can be raised with the <code>logkit.xconf</code>
          configuration. If you are using Forrest in the interactive webapp
          mode (which is generally easiest for debugging errors) then see the
          <code>build/webapp/WEB-INF/logkit.xconf</code> file.
          If you are generating a static site (with command-line 'forrest')
          then copy <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/logkit.xconf</code>
          to your project at
          <code>src/documentation/content/conf/logkit.xconf</code>
          and modify it. See more information and efficiency tips with
