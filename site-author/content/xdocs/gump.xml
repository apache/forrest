      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        <a href="http://gump.apache.org/">Apache Gump</a> builds Apache Forrest
        trunk and the latest development versions of each of our dependencies.
        This enables early detection of issues. Part of Gump's aim is to 
        draw people beyond the project boundaries and assist with community
        integration and collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Forrest has many dependencies, we happen towards the end of
        the run.
        If dependencies (e.g. Apache Cocoon and certain blocks, Apache Xalan, etc.)
        fail, then of course the build of Forrest will fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        The successful use of Forrest via Gump, indicates that we could update
        our supporting products to more recent versions.
      </p>
      <note>
        Gump is using a packaged version of Cocoon-2.1 (Cocoon-2.1.11) at the
        moment.

        projects.
