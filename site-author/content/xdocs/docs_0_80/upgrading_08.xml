      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        This page describes some changes to Apache Forrest that affect people
        who are upgrading to the 0.8 version. If you have other issues, then
        please discuss on either the
        <a href="site:mail-lists/forrest-dev">dev</a> or
        <a href="site:mail-lists/forrest-user">user</a> mailing lists. As more
        experience is gained, this document will be updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        (If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.7 then you will need to
        see the notes for the previous upgrade.)
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="new">
      <title>New Features</title>
      <p>
        The following list shows some of the key new features. For the full list
        of changes, see the main <a href="site:changes">change log</a> and also
        for each plugin.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="site:locationmap">Locationmaps</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many new initial plugins are in the "whiteboard". See the entries in the
        <a href="site:changes">change log</a> and see each plugin's
        documentation and changes log. This includes the new Dispatcher. See
        <a href="site:status-themes">Status of Themes: Skins and Dispatcher</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="locationmaps">
      <title>Locationmaps</title>
      <p>
        The <a href="site:locationmap">Locationmaps</a> define the mapping from
        requests to locations which enables content and resources to be located
        at various different sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding a default locationmap to your project is not required, but is
        advisable. Sooner or later you will use it. Having a default one also
        reduces the verbosity of the log files. Copy one from a fresh 'forrest
        seed' to
        <code>PROJECT_HOME/src/documentation/content/locationmap.xml</code>
      </p>
      <warning>
        If you do use locationmaps and an entry for a specific request is
        missing Forrest generates a confusing error message. Please ask on our
        mailing lists for help in debugging your problem (hint, turn on
        locationmap debugging in
        [FORREST_HOME]/main/webapp/WEB-INF/logkit.xconf, restart Forrest,
        request the broken pages and visit
        [SITE_HOME]/build/webapp/logs/locationmap.xml). This issue will be fixed
        in the next version of Forrest.
      </warning>

    <section id="config">
      <title>Prototype xml-based properties system</title>
      <p>
        Prototype of new xml-based properties system.
        Projects and plugins can use a forrest.properties.xml file.
        At this stage, it supplements the existing forrest.properties file.
        See the projectInfo plugin for an example of its use. Search the dev
        mailing list for more information.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="modules">
      <title>Forrest configuration simplification</title>
      <p>
        <strong>FOR-920</strong> Merging the <code>defaults</code> and
        <code>project</code> modules to the new <code>properties</code> module.
        You can use it like {properties:forrest.home}
      </p>
      <p>
        In all custom code (e.g. <a href="site:project-sitemap">project sitemap</a> or <a href="site:plugins/using">plugins sitemaps</a>) you need to do the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>find:
          <code>{defaults:</code> and replace with
          <code>{properties:forrest.</code></li>
        <li>find:
          <code>{forrest:</code> and replace with
          <code>{forrest:forrest.</code> or
          <code>{properties:forrest.</code> (if you do not need the
          ChainMetaModule)</li>
        <li>find:
          <code>{project:</code> and replace with
          <code>{properties:</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The consequence of not making such corrections is an error message similar to the following:
      </p>
      <source>Could not find component for role:
[org.apache.cocoon.components.modules.input.InputModule/project]</source>
      <p>
        The most likely cuplrit is forgetting to edit your "project sitemap" explained <a href="#project-sitemap">below</a>. 
        See the <a href="site:glossary">glossary</a> if you are confused by terminology.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="clean">
      <title>Run a clean target after upgrade</title>
      <p>
        Do 'forrest clean-work' in each of your projects. This also removes the
        old Cocoon disk cache.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="to2to">
      <title>New filename convention for stylesheets</title>
      <p>
        There is now a filenaming convention for stylesheets (e.g.
        document-to-html.xsl). This assists with automating the location of such
        resources. See <a href="site:locationmap">Locationmap</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the default use of Forrest, this makes no difference. However, if
        you have developed your own skin then you will need to do some filename
        changes, e.g. <code>'cd skins/my-skin/xslt/html; mv tab2menu.xsl
        tab-to-menu.xsl'</code> (do each of book2menu.xsl document2html.xsl
        site2xhtml.xsl tab2menu.xsl). It is advisable to follow this naming
        convention for your other resources, which will mean that you can
        utilise the locationmap.

    <section id="docs">
      <title>Notes about documentation</title>
      <p>
        After each release, the "Versioned Docs" are copied to form the new
        "dev" set. Ideally the docs are then upgraded in readiness for the new
        release. This has not been completed for the 0.8 release. In particular
        there are example snippets of sitemaps which have not yet been upgraded
        to reflect the changes to the sitemaps and the separation of some core
        stuff into plugins. See issues
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-546">FOR-546</a> and
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-922">FOR-922</a> and
        others.

    <section id="cocoon">
      <title>Notes about Cocoon version</title>
      <p>
        The last time that we upgraded our packaged version of Cocoon trunk was
        using their SVN r351990 on 2005-12-08. Since then a number of things
        have happened to cause us to fall out of synchronisation with Cocoon.
        There is various discussion about this in the Forrest and Cocoon dev
        mail archives.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use your own version of Cocoon, then you will know about the
        upgrade notes in the $FORREST_HOME/etc/cocoon_upgrade directory. You
        might be able to advance a bit beyond the SVN revision, but not much.
        Please help to rectify this situation.
        See <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1015">FOR-1015</a>.

    <section id="xmlformat">
      <title>Whitespace and indenting of xml files with xmlformat</title>
      <p>
        All xml type files have been formatted using xmlformat. You can apply
        this to your own work if necessary by using the same configuration as
        the Forrest project. See notes at
        <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-644">FOR-644</a>.

      <title>General upgrade tips</title>
      <p>
        Synchronise your project's skinconf.xml and forrest.properties files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take advantage of the separation of concerns. In a new workspace, create
        a fresh '<code>forrest seed</code>' site, then tweak its
        forrest.properties and skinconf.xml until it reflects your old site.
        When it is ready, replace your project's skinconf.xml and
        forrest.properties files. Any remaining issues would concern other
        aspects of your configuration, such as site.xml and your actual content.
      </p>

    <section id="project-sitemap">
      <title>Remove project sitemap if not necessary</title>
      <p>
        It has come to our attention that some people have a 
        <a href="site:project-sitemap">project sitemap</a>
        even though they are not using it. Such un-necessary sitemaps should be
        removed to avoid maintenance issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do use a project sitemap, then pay attention to the upgrade
        instructions "<a href="#modules">Forrest configuration simplification</a>" above.
