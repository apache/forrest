##########################################################

#branding (b)
Container used for all elements that is branding the site.
Everything releated to brand the site goes in here.

#b-trail -> branding-trail
Used for a trail or tagline to define the site's purpose

#branding-logo (bl)
Contains all logos to brand the site.
Everything releated with logos to brand the site goes in here.

#bl-group -> branding-logo-group
Used for the grouplogo.

#search (se)
Related to search interface and search results

#nav or #navigation (n)
Used to contain the navigation devices

#content (c)
Used for content rather than for another purpose such as navigation

#siteinfo (si)
Used for various site related information

The problem that I am facing if I want to use e.g. the nav container for all nav elements is to still have the same style. 
The style depends on overall (IMO style specific) style-divs that are just for web-design reason. 
That would denegate a single skeleton for css-contracts like css-garden. 
One could introduce a raster approach but that would be more or less the top-main-footer approach.

Breaking down the problem again to #id basis. The pathing of them makes the final style.
