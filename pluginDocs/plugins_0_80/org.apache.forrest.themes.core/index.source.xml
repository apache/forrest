  <title>How to create your own implementation </title>

generate XHTML content for the tabs to make it "most amenable" to CSS
skinning. Personally, I would just output each tab in its own div
element, with class attributes denoting the selected tab. One can then
use CSS to structure/color them appropriately."</p>
<note>All following explanations/steps assume you use the default
configuration of forrest.</note>
	<p>Ok, you may want to try another feature that is coming with
forrest:views.</p>

	<title>Create your own contract implementation</title>
		<ol>
		<li>Create in src/documentation the folder resources/templates. ...or
more generally speaking create ${project.resources-dir}/templates.</li>
		<li>Copy
{this.plugins.path}/resources/templates/nav-main.ft to this folder.
</li>
		<li>Add after the &lt;xsl:template name="nav-main-body"/&gt; something like 
</li>
</ol>
		<source xml:space="preserve">&lt;xsl:template match="ul[@id='nav-main']"&gt;
&lt;div id="nav-main"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="li"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match="li[not(@class)]"&gt;
&lt;div class="base-not-selected"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match="li[@class='current']"&gt;
&lt;div class="current"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</source>
<ol>
<li>Change the css in &lt;xsl:template name="nav-main-css"&gt;. I tried but
the result is not nice. If you succeed please change the name of the
contract to "nav-main-div", add the patch to the issue-tracker and I add
the new contract to the themer plugin. ;-)</li>

  <p>You can find more implementations in {this.plugins.path}/resources/templates/.</p>
