<!--
This build.xml import contains Forrest targets for Ant 1.6.
See the forrest-targets.ent file in this same dir for more info.

Sample usage:

  <import file="forrest-targets.ent"/>

If you already have in your build targets that are called like the 
forrest ones, you can still call the forrest ones by prepending 
"forrest."

Example:

 <antcall target="forrest.site"/>
-->
<!DOCTYPE project [
<!ENTITY forrest-targets SYSTEM "file:./forrest-targets.ent">
]>

<project name="forrest" default="dist" basedir="."  >
    &forrest-targets;
</project>
