  <title>Apache Forrest project guidelines</title>

<body> 

  <p>
   This document provides the guidelines under which the Apache Forrest
   project operates. It defines the roles and responsibilities, who may vote,
   how voting works, how conflicts are resolved, etc.
   Apache Forrest is a project of the Apache Software Foundation
   (<link href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">ASF</link>) which is a
   non-profit corporation. As with all such organistions there are some
   procedures to be followed.
   The ASF website explains the
   operation and background of the ASF. These project guidelines supplement that
   ASF documentation. Normally these guidelines are not needed - the project
   just gets on with its day-to-day operation - but they enable
   all people to understand how the project operates.

    <title>The Apache Way</title>
    <p>
      Forrest is typical of Apache projects, in that it operates under a set of
      principles known collectively as the "Apache Way". This facilitates
      open collaborative development, with respect for others.
      For more information about how Apache projects operate, please refer to
      the
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">ASF foundation</link>
      and

    <title>Project Management Committee (PMC)</title>
    <p>The Apache Forrest project was established in January 2002 and became a
      top-level project in May 2004.
      The Project Management Committee (PMC) was created by a
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2004/board_minutes_2004_05_26.txt">resolution</link>
      of the board of the Apache Software Foundation.
      See explanation of the role of the PMC in that resolution and also the
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html">ASF Bylaws</link>
      and 
    <link href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc">How-it-works</link>.
    </p>
    <p>The responsibilities of the PMC include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be familiar with these project guidelines, and the
      ASF Bylaws, and with the ASF documentation and procedures
      in general.</li>
      <li>Keep oversight of the commit log messages and ensure that
       the codebase does not have copyright and license issues.</li>
      <li>Resolve license disputes regarding products of the project,
        including other supporting software that is re-distributed.</li>
      <li>Decide what is distributed as products of the project.
        In particular all releases must be approved by the PMC.</li>
      <li>Guide the direction of the project.</li>
      <li>Strive for and help to facilitate a harmonious productive community.</li>
      <li>Nominate new PMC members and committers.</li>
      <li>Maintain the project's shared resources, including the
        codebase repository, mailing lists, websites.</li>
      <li>Speak on behalf of the project.</li>
      <li>Maintain these and other guidelines of the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The PMC does have a private mailing list on which it can discuss
      certain issues. However this list is rarely used and every effort
      is made to conduct all discussion on the public mailing lists.
    </p>

    <p>
      Membership of the PMC is by invitation only and must receive
      consensus approval of the active PMC members.
    </p> 
    <p>
      A PMC member is considered
      "emeritus" by their own declaration or by not contributing in
      any form to the project for over six months. An emeritus member may
      request reinstatement to the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to
      consensus approval of the active PMC members. Membership of the PMC can be
      revoked by unanimous consensus of all active PMC members (other than
      the member in question).
    </p>

    <p>
      The chair of the PMC is appointed by the Board and is an officer of
      the ASF (Vice President). The chair has primary responsibility to the
      Board, and has the power to establish rules and procedures for the
      day-to-day management of the communities for which the PMC is
      responsible, including the composition of the PMC itself.
      The chair reports to the board every three months about the status of the
      project. The PMC may consider the position of PMC chair annually and 
      may recommend a new chair to the board.
      Ultimately, however, it is the board's responsibility who it chooses
      to appoint as the PMC chair.
      See further explanation of the role of the chair in the
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html">ASF Bylaws</link>
      and the
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#chair">PMC FAQ</link>

    <section id="report">
      <title>Quarterly reports to ASF Board</title>
      <p>
        Every three months, it is the responsibility of our PMC chair to
        send a report to the ASF Board. This is mainly concerned with the
        status of our community, but can also include the technical progress.
        Further details are in the "committers" SVN in the /board/ directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The minutes are available for each

    <section id="elect">
      <title>Electing new committers and PMC members</title>
      <p>
        We conduct the vote on the private PMC mailing list to enable a frank
        discussion.
        In most cases we will be inviting people to go straight from developer
        to PMC member, i.e. they simultaneously become committer and PMC
        member. However, there may be extraordinary cases where we want
        limited work-related commit access (not also a PMC member).
        This will be resolved during the discussion and vote.
        Notes about this process are in the "committers" svn in the
        pmc/forrest/ directory.

  <section id="decision">
    <title>Decision making</title>
    <p>
      Different types of decisions require different
      forms of approval. For example, the previous section describes
      several decisions which require "consensus approval". This
      section defines how voting is performed, the types of approval, and which
      types of decision require which type of approval.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most day-to-day operations do not require explicit voting - just get on
      and do the work. See the "Lazy approval" type described below.
    </p>

    <section id="voting">
      <title>Voting</title>
      <p>
        Certain actions and decisions regarding the project are made by votes
        on the project development mailing list. Where necessary,
        PMC voting may take place on the private PMC mailing list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Votes are clearly indicated by subject line starting with [VOTE].
        Discussion and proposal should have happened prior to the vote.
        Voting is carried out by replying to the vote mail. 
        See <link href="#procedure">voting procedure</link> below.
        Votes are expressed using one of the following symbols:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>+1</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            "Yes," "Agree," or "the action should be
            performed." In general, this vote also indicates a willingness
            on the behalf of the voter to assist with "making it happen".
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>+0</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            This vote indicates a willingness for the action under
            consideration to go ahead. The voter, however will not be able
            to help.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>-0</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            This vote indicates that the voter does not, in general, agree with
            the proposed action but is not concerned enough to prevent the
            action going ahead.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>-1</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            This is a negative vote. On issues where consensus is required,
            this vote counts as a <link href="#veto">veto</link>.
            All vetoes must
            contain an explanation of why the veto is appropriate. Vetoes with
            no explanation are void. It may also be appropriate for a -1 vote
            to include an alternative course of action.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>abstain</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">People can abstain from voting. They can either remain
          silent or express their reason.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        All participants in the project are encouraged to show their
        preference for a particular action by voting. When the votes are
        tallied, only the votes of PMC members are binding. Non-binding
        votes are still useful to enable everyone to understand the
        perception of an action by the wider community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Voting can also be applied to changes made to the project codebase. These
        typically take the form of a veto (-1) in reply to the commit message
        sent when the commit is made.

    <section id="approvals">
      <title>Types of approval</title>

          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Consensus approval</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Lazy majority</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            An action with lazy approval is implicitly allowed unless a -1 vote
            is received, at which time, depending on the type of action, either
            lazy majority or consensus approval must be obtained.
          </td>

          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            Some actions require a 2/3 majority of active PMC members.
            Such actions typically affect the foundation
            of the project (e.g. adopting a new codebase to replace an existing
            product). The higher threshold is designed to ensure such changes
            are strongly supported. To pass this vote requires at least 2/3 of
            binding vote holders to vote +1

      <title>Vetoes</title>
      <p>
        A valid veto cannot be over-ruled, it can only be withdrawn by its issuer.
        Any veto must be accompanied by reasoning and be prepared to defend it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The validity of a veto, if challenged, can be confirmed by anyone who
        has a binding vote. This does not necessarily signify agreement with the
        veto - merely that the veto is valid. In case of disputes about whether
        a veto is valid, then opinion of the PMC chair is final.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you disagree with a valid veto, then you must engage the person
        casting the veto to further discuss the issues. The vetoer is obliged
        to vote early and to then work with the community to resolve
        the matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a veto is not withdrawn, the action that has been vetoed must
        be reversed in a timely manner.

        For breakdown situations and those requiring unanimous consensus,
        if this consensus cannot be reached within the extended timeframe,
        then the Board expects the chair to act as the officer of the
        Foundation and make the ultimate decision.

  <section id="communication">
    <title>Communication channels</title>
    <p>
      The primary mechanism for communication is the mailing lists.
      Anyone can participate, no matter what their time zone.
      A reliable searchable archive of past discussion is built.
      Oversight is enabled. Many eyes ensures that the project evolves
      in a consistent direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      All decisions are made on the "dev" mailing list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main channel for user support is the "user" mailing list.
      As is usual with mailing lists, be prepared to wait for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally we will use other communication channels such as IRC.
      These are used only for a specific purpose and are not permanently
      available. This policy ensures that solutions are available in the
      mailing list archives and enables people to respond at whatever time
      that they choose. Permanent IRC channels are poor from a community-building
      point-of-view, as they tend to create time-zone based cliques.
      So we don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, private discussions are discouraged. The rest of the community
      would not benefit from the understanding that is developed.
      Off-list discussions put too much load on overworked volunteers.

  <section id="code">
    <title>Code management</title>

    <p>
      The term "patch" has two meanings: Developers provide a set of changes
      via our <link href="site:bugs">Issue Tracker</link> marked for inclusion,
      which will be applied by a committer. Committers apply their own work
      directly, but it is still essentially a patch.
    </p>

    <p>
      We use the
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#CommitThenReview">Commit-then-review</link>
      method for decision-making about code changes. Please refer to that
      glossary definition. Note that it does not preclude the committer
      from making changes to patches prior to their commit, nor mean that the
      committer can be careless. Rather it is a policy for decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is an important issue where both developers and committers need
      to pay special attention: "licenses". We must not introduce licensing
      conditions that go beyond the terms of the <link href="ext:asl">Apache License</link>.
      If such issues do creep in to our repository, then we must work as
      quickly as possible to address it and definitely before the next release.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are some other problem areas:
      What should a committer do if the patch is sloppy, containing inconsistent
      whitespace and other code formatting, which mean that actual changes are not
      easily visible in the svn diff messages. What if there is poorly constructed
      (yet working) xml or java code? What if the new functionality is beyond the
      scope of the project? What if there is a better way to do the task? What if
      the patch will break the build, thereby preventing other developers from
      working and causing an unstable trunk?
    </p>

    <p>
      The committer has various options: ask the developer to resubmit the patch;
      change the patch to fix the problems prior to committing; discuss the
      issues on the dev list; commit it and then draw attention to the
      issues so that the rest of the community can review and fix it.
      A combination of these options would appear to be the best approach.
      Please aim to not break the build, or introduce license problems, or make
      noisy changes that obscure the real differences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Committers should not be afraid to add changes that still need attention.
      This enables prompt patch application and eases the load on the individual
      committer. An interesting side-effect is that it encourages community growth.

  <section id="develop">
    <title>Development procedure</title>

<note>
  This section is still under development. The issues have been discussed
  on the mailing list. Decisions need to be put into words, so that we do
  not need to revisit the topic.
</note>

    <p>
     Development work is done on the trunk of SVN.
     Wherever possible, functionality is contained in "plugins". 
     There are "release branches" of SVN, e.g. forrest_07_branch.
    </p>

<fixme author="open">
The following issues still need to be added above.
There are also some relevant email threads, from which we need to extract info.
</fixme>
    <source xml:space="preserve">
* Define our policy for adding changes to release branch.
* Define the purpose of the "whiteboard/incubator".
* Declare that we only really maintain the current release branch

The default is lazy consensus. So just get on with the job
unless someone asks to stop, review, perhaps revert.

Mention the "Contributer License Agreement".
Who needs to send it? ... is it committers plus major contributers?
