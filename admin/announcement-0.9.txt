Subject: [Announce] Apache Forrest 0.9 released

The Apache Forrest project is pleased to release the new version:
apache-forrest-0.9 http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi

Apache Forrest (tm) software is a publishing framework
that transforms input from various sources into a unified
presentation in one or more output formats. The modular
and extensible plug-in architecture of Apache Forrest
is based on Apache Cocoon and the relevant industry
standards that separate presentation from content.
Forrest can generate static documents, or be used as a
dynamic server, or be deployed by its automated facility.

Features of this version include:

* Consolidation and bug fixing.

* Our packaged version of Apache Cocoon has been upgraded
to use the latest version of their stable 2.1 branch.
