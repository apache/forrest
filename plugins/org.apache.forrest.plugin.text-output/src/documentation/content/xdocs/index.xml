    <title>Welcome to the Text Plugin</title>

      <title>Apache Forrest - Text Plugin</title>

      <p>This plugin allows Forrest files to be output as simple text.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>How to Use the Text Plugin</title>

      <p>The plugin needs to be incorporated into your existing build of
      Forrest. To do this,</p>

      <ol>
        <li><code>cd $FORREST_HOME/plugin/</code></li>

        <li><code>$FORREST_HOME/tools/ant/bin/ant local-deploy</code></li>

        <li>At this point, you'll be asked the name of the plugin to deploy.
        The name of this plugin is <strong>org.apache.forrest.plugin.text-output</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p>Once you have the text plugin installed, it is simply a case of
      requesting a file with an txt extension. For example, <a
      href="index.txt">this page as text</a>.</p>

      <title>Features</title>

      <p>Overall, each section and subsection are indented by two spaces.
      First level sections are underlined with equal signs, '='. Second level
      sections with dashes, '-'. Third level sections are underlined with '-.'
      and fourth level sections with dots, '.'.</p>

      <section>
        <title>Second Level Section</title>

        <section>
          <title>Third Level Section</title>

          <section>
            <title>Fourth Level Section</title>
          </section>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Lists</title>

        <ul>
          <li>This is an unordered list. Notice that each list item is text
          wrapped and hangining indents are also implmented.</li>

          <li>This is the second item in this unordered list. Notice also how
          the indents of the current section are also applied to the lists
          themselves.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li>This is an ordered list, meaning that the each list item is
          numbered.</li>

          <li><p>Again, the indentation of the current section is applied as
          well as a hanging indent for text that wraps around.</p><p>Also
          notice that each list item can have multiple paragraphs by making
          sure that the text is enclosed in paragraph, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,
          elements.</p></li>

          <li>The final element in this ordered list.</li>
        </ol>

        <dl>
          <dt>Definition Lists</dt>

          <dd>Lists that have a definition term followed by text that defines
          the term. Again, notice the hanging indents.</dd>
        </dl>

        <title>Tables</title>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>First Column</th>

            <th>Second Column</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>Just some text to show that text within tables cells is also
            wrapped.</td>

            <td><p>In order to use multiple paragraphs in a table cell, wrap
            each paragraph in &lt;p&gt; elements.</p><p>Just like in this
            cell.</p></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Nesting Lists, Tables</title>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Lists</th>

            <th>Tables</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td><ol>
                <li><p>We can even have lists within tables.</p></li>

                <li><p>Again, these are handled pretty well.</p></li>
              </ol></td>

            <td><table>
                <tr>
                  <td>Nested Tables</td>

                  <td>With Lists</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td>There is a limit tho.</td>

                  <td><ul>
                      <li><p>First item</p></li>

                      <li><p>Second Item</p></li>
                    </ul></td>
                </tr>
              </table></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td><ul>
                <li>Bulletted items work in here as well.</li>

                <li>This is the second item.</li>
              </ul></td>

            <td>This cell intentionally left blank.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Limitations</title>

      <section>
        <title>Use the &lt;p&gt; element</title>

        <p>Generally, text wrapping in list items and in table cells will work
        better if the text in those item is enclosed in &lt;p&gt; elements.
        For example, we'll take the table above and remove the &lt;p&gt;
        elements from the list items, the &lt;li&gt; elements.</p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Lists</th>

            <th>Tables</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td><ol>
                <li>We can even have lists within tables.</li>

                <li>Again, these are handled pretty well.</li>
              </ol></td>

            <td><table>
                <tr>
                  <td>Nested Tables</td>

                  <td>With Lists</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                  <td>There is a limit tho.</td>

                  <td><ul>
                      <li>First item</li>

                      <li>Second Item</li>
                    </ul></td>
                </tr>
              </table></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td><ul>
                <li>Bulletted items work in here as well.</li>

                <li>This is the second item.</li>
              </ul></td>

            <td>This cell intentionally left blank.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>You can see that some of the text wrapping gets messed up.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Table Cell Minimum Width </title>

        <p>Table cells, even when nested, have a minimum width of 10 defined.
        This means that when nesting tables, that minimum width will be
        quickly hit and the formatting will get, for lack of a better word,
        gibbled. An example will help illustrate the point.</p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>First of Three Columns</td>

            <td>Second of Three Columns</td>

            <td>Third of Three Columns</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td><table>
                <tr>
                  <td>Nested</td>

                  <td>Four</td>

                  <td>Column</td>

                  <td>Table</td>
                </tr>
              </table></td>

            <td>You can see how the first column is gibbled</td>

            <td>That is simply due to the minimum column width
            requirement.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>
    </section>
