      <p>Follow these steps to create a new table in Excel:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set the document title in <code>File&rarr;Properties...</code></li>
        <li>Set the sheet's title as section title; 
            Put each table in a separate sheet</li>
        <li>Create a table header in the first row</li>
        <li>Insert your content into the table</li>
        <li>Put spaces into empty cells</li>
        <li>
	  Set the output format to XML: <code>File&rarr;Save as...</code>,
	  then select File type <code>XML</code>
        </li>
        <li>
	  Choose a filename that ends in <code>-table.xml</code> and save
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>You may open the XML file directly with Excel afterwards.</p>
      <p>

        Include your table in forrest
      </title>
      <p>Follow these steps to include a new table in your project:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
	  In your <code>forrest.properties</code> file:
	  Include <code>org.apache.forrest.plugin.excel</code> in
	  <code>project.required.plugins</code> 
        </li>
        <li>
	  Include the file in your <code>site.xml</code> as usual:
	  <code>&lt;mytable label="My Table" href="my-table.xml"/&gt;</code>
        </li>
      </ol>
        <note>
	  The plugin will treat <strong>all</strong> files ending in
	  <code>-table.xml</code> as Excel-XML files.

      <title>Including figures</title>
        <p>
          If you want to include a figure above your table, put the
	  keyword <code>figure</code> into the first column and the
	  path into the second column (relative to <code>images</code>).
	  You may include a caption in the fourth (4th) column.
	  See the <a href="site:figure-table">Table with figure</a>
	  as an example.

        <p>
          If you want to include a descriptive text for a section, put
	  the keyword <code>text</code> into the first column and
	  the text itself into the second column. You may include more
          than one paragraph.

	  Coloring cells
        </title>
        <p>
	  For a color table you may specify the background color for
	  single cells: put the color's hex-triplet (e.g. 
	  <code>#FFD0AA</code>) into the cell. Make sure this is the
	  only content.
	  See the <a href="site:color-table">Color Table</a>
	  as an example.
