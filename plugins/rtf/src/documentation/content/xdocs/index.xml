      <title>How to Use the RTF Plugin</title>
      <p>Currently, there is no auto-install feature for the RTF plugin
      since it is pre-alpha. For installation instructions see the 
      <code>README.txt</code> file.</p>
      
      <p>Once you have the RTF plugin installed, it is simply a case of
      requesting a file with an rtf extension. For example,
      <a href="samples/minimal.rtf">samples/minimal.rtf</a>.</p>
      
      <warning>Currently, the Forrest generated fo files are not working
      in this RTF plugin. See the <a href="todo.html">To Do List</a> for more 
      details.</warning>
