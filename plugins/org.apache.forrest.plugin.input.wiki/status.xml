    <release version="0.2-dev" date="not-released">
      <action type="fix" context="code" dev="SNM">
        Some small changes to allow for colons in table titles.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" context="code" dev="SNM">
        Allow more items as (the first) symbol(s) within inline elements.
      </action>
      <action type="add" context="code" dev="SNM">
        Removed unneccessary block of reserved characters inside em, strong and
        code elements.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" context="code" dev="SNM">
        The list of cases for when NOT to add a space after a text segment was
        incomplete, thus several constructs contained spaces not in the original
        input. Now fixed for all common punctuation in the Latin script. The
        list can easily be extended if need be.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" context="code" dev="SNM">
        Corrected a regression introduced in the previous fix.
      </action>
      <action type="add" context="code" dev="SNM">
        Made i18n support in the wiki plugin configurable, by way of an xml
        configuration file. The default is false.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" context="code" dev="SNM">
        Added support for definition list constructs (<code>;Term:definition</code>).
        Fixed numerous spacing bugs: extra or missing spaces after inline elements.
        Improved support for inline formatting and breaks, especially in tables.
        Fixed processing of no-link constructs: <code>[[text]</code> should be
        rendered as <code>[text]</code>, earlier it was rendered as <code>[[text]</code>.
        The plugin should now support all relevant <a
        href="http://www.jspwiki.org/wiki/TextFormattingRules">jspwiki markup</a>.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" context="code" dev="SNM">
        Fixed locationmap resource lookup, so that it is possible to override the
        wiki parsing grammar and the wiki2xdocs stylesheet in the projecct source tree.
      </action>
      <action type="add" context="code" dev="SNM">
        Added handling of localised content in wiki format, that is, filenames following the
        <code>filename.locale.wiki</code> format, where each <code>locale</code> variant
        contains a localised version of the content.
      </action>
      <action type="add" context="code" dev="RDG">
        Added handling of Google Code wiki format. See <a href="site:sample/google">sample</a>.

        due-to="Sjur N. Moshagen, Gavin">
        Corrected processing of nested lists so that sub-lists are properly
        nested within the LI of the outer list, thus bringing the output in
        accordance with the HTML DTD.
      </action>
      <action type="add" context="code" dev="RDG" importance="high">
