    <h1>WYSIWYG Editing In Apache Forrest</h1>
    <p>This plugin provides <span style="font-style: italic;">WYSIWYG</span> editing for the Apache Forrest appliction. 
    It currently only works with HTML input files, but we hope to extend its range of supported file formats.</p>
    
    <p>This plugin uses <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/itools-htmlarea/">HTML Area</a> for
    the editing widget.</p>
    
    <warning>With the current configuration this plugin produces HTML with
    embedded stule information (not just CSS stuff). A future version will only 
    use CSS styling, but for now be ware that the source can be bad from a 
    separation of content and style perspective</warning>
    
    <h2>Try it out</h2>
    <h1>How do I allow users to edit my Pages?</h1>
    <p>If a request is recieved with an URL that contains "edit_htmlArea/" then an edit page is generated for the indicated page. For example:</p>
    <p class="source">
      @lt;a href="/edit_htmlArea/index.html"@gt;edit index&lt;/a&gt;
    </p>
    <p>will create an editor for the <code>index.html</code> page.</p>
