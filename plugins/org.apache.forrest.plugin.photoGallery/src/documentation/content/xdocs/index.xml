      <title>Apache Forrest - org.apache.forrest.plugin.gallery Plugin</title>
      <p>This plugin creates a photo album from photographs.</p>
      
      <p>The pictures are expected under 
      <code>{project:content.xdocs}/images/gallery/**</code> in 
      folders called <code>preview</code>, <code>small</code> and  
      <code>big</code>.</p>
      
      <p>To view a screen of thumbnails (generated from the <code>preview</code>
      directory), you need to request an URL in the form of 
      <code>gallery/**/index.html</code>. By default 20 pictures will be 
      displayed. If you have more than 20 then you will need to use an URL in
      the form of <code>gallery/**/index_X.html</code> (where X is the page 
      number you want to view). 
      See our <a href="gallery/demo/index_1.html">demo index</a> for an example.</p>
      
      <p>To view a single picture at a size optimised for the delivery mecahnism 
      (generated from the <code>small</code> directory), you need to request an 
      URL in the form of <code>gallery/**/pic_PICTURE_NUMBER.html</code>,
      where PICTURE_NUMBER is the number of the picture you want to display.
      See our <a href="gallery/demo/pic_1.html">demo one picture</a>,
      <a href="gallery/demo/pic_2.html">demo two picture</a>, 
      <a href="gallery/demo/pic_3.html">demo three picture</a> for examples.</p>
      
      <p>To view a single picture at its natural size 
      (generated from the <code>big</code> directory), you need to request an 
      URL in the form of <code>gallery/**/fullPic_PICTURE_NUMBER.html</code>.
      See our <a href="gallery/demo/fullPic_1.html">demo one picture</a>,
      <a href="gallery/demo/fullPic_2.html">demo two picture</a>, 
      <a href="gallery/demo/fullPic_3.html">demo three picture</a> for examples.</p>
      
      <note>To create the relevant directory stuctures for your gallery simply
      run the following script (unix only). We hope to enhance this plugin
      so that it will automatically create the relevant images for you, but
      for now you must do it by hand.</note>
