    <title>Feeder Plugin - Single Feed Example</title> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
    
    <p>This sample shows how a single RSS feed can be converted to an XDoc and
    included in a Forrest site. In order to do this you must first create a
    <code>feedDescriptor</code> file. This describes all the feeds that your
    project knows about. A simple example is:</p>
      
    <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
<feedDescriptor>
  <feed id="planetApache">
    <url>http://www.planetapache.org/rss20.xml</url>
  </feed>
</feedDescriptor>
    ]]></source>
      
    <p>In order to embed the data from the <code>planetApache</code> feed
    you create a link in the following form:</p>
    
    <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<a href="PATH_TO_FEED_DESCRIPTOR/feeder/FEED_DESCRIPTOR_NAME.EXTENSION>]]></source>
    
    <p>In this URL you must replace <code>PATH_TO_FEED_DESCRIPTOR</code>
    with the directory path to your feed descriptor file, 
    <code>FEED_DESCRIPTOR_NAME</code> with the name of the descriptor file,
    and <code>EXTENSION</code> with the extension indicating the format you
    want the feed to be delivered in (i.e. html, pdf etc.)</p>
    
    <p>For example <link href="/samples/feeder/feedDescriptor.html">/samples/feeder/feedDescriptor.html</link>
    will display the feed shown above.</p>
    
    <warning>The way URLs are structured is due to change in the near future,
    use at your own risk (see Forrest mailing lists for discussion).</warning>
