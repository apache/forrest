   This document provides the guidelines under which the Apache Forrest
   project operates. It defines the roles and responsibilities, who may vote,
   how voting works, how conflicts are resolved, etc.
   Apache Forrest is a project of the Apache Software Foundation
   (<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">ASF</a>) which holds
   the copyright for all Apache projects. The ASF website explains the
   operation and background of the ASF. These project guidelines supplement that
   ASF documentation. Normally these guidelines are not needed - the project
   just gets on with its day-to-day operation - but they enable
   all people to understand how the project operates.

<h2 class="underlined_10">The Apache Way</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
      Forrest is typical of Apache projects, in that it operates under a set of
      principles known collectively as the "Apache Way". This facilitates
      open collaborative development, with respect for others.
      For more information about how Apache projects operate, please refer to
      the

<a name="N10068"></a><a name="pmc"></a>
<h2 class="underlined_10">Project Management Committee (PMC)</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>The Apache Forrest project was established in January 2002 and became a
      top-level project in May 2004.
      The Project Management Committee (PMC) was created by a
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2004/board_minutes_2004_05_26.txt">resolution</a>
      of the board of the Apache Software Foundation.
      See explanation of the role of the PMC in that resolution and also the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html">ASF Bylaws</a>
      and 
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#pmc">How-it-works</a>.
    </p>
<p>The responsibilities of the PMC include:</p>
<ul>
      
<li>Be familiar with these project guidelines, and the
      ASF Bylaws, and with the ASF documentation and procedures
      in general.</li>
      
<li>Keep oversight of the commit log messages and ensure that
       the codebase does not have copyright and license issues.</li>
      
<li>Resolve license disputes regarding products of the project,
        including other supporting software that is re-distributed.</li>
      
<li>Decide what is distributed as products of the project.
        In particular all releases must be approved by the PMC.</li>
      
<li>Guide the direction of the project.</li>
      
<li>Strive for and help to facilitate a harmonious productive community.</li>
      
<li>Nominate new PMC members and committers.</li>
      
<li>Maintain the project's shared resources, including the
        codebase repository, mailing lists, websites.</li>
      
<li>Speak on behalf of the project.</li>
      
<li>Maintain these and other guidelines of the project.</li>
    
</ul>
<p>
      The PMC does have a private mailing list on which it can discuss
      certain issues. However this list is rarely used and every effort
      is made to conduct all discussion on the public mailing lists.
    </p>
<p>
      Membership of the PMC is by invitation only and must receive
      consensus approval of the active PMC members.
    </p>
<p>
      A PMC member is considered
      "emeritus" by their own declaration or by not contributing in
      any form to the project for over six months. An emeritus member may
      request reinstatement to the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to
      consensus approval of the active PMC members. Membership of the PMC can be
      revoked by unanimous consensus of all active PMC members (other than
      the member in question).
    </p>
<p>
      The chair of the PMC is appointed by the Board and is an officer of
      the ASF (Vice President). The chair has primary responsibility to the
      Board, and has the power to establish rules and procedures for the
      day to day management of the communities for which the PMC is
      responsible, including the composition of the PMC itself.
      The chair reports to the board quarterly on developments within the
      project. The PMC may consider the position of PMC chair annually and 
      may recommend a new chair to the board.
      Ultimately, however, it is the board's responsibility who it chooses
      to appoint as the PMC chair.
      See further explanation of the role of the chair in the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html">ASF Bylaws</a>
      and the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#chair">PMC FAQ</a>

<a name="N100B6"></a><a name="decision"></a>
<h2 class="underlined_10">Decision making</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
      Different types of decisions require different
      forms of approval. For example, the previous section describes
      several decisions which require "consensus approval". This
      section defines how voting is performed, the types of approval, and which
      types of decision require which type of approval.
    </p>
<p>
      Most day-to-day operations do not require explicit voting - just get on
      and do the work. See the "Lazy approval" type described below.
    </p>
<a name="N100C2"></a><a name="voting"></a>
<h3 class="underlined_5">Voting</h3>
<p>
        Certain actions and decisions regarding the project are made by votes
        on the project development mailing list. Where necessary,
        PMC voting may take place on the private PMC mailing list.
      </p>
<p>
        Votes are clearly indicated by subject line starting with [VOTE].
        Discussion and proposal should have happened prior to the vote.
        Voting is carried out by replying to the vote mail. 
        See <a href="#procedure">voting procedure</a> below.
        Votes are expressed using one of the following symbols:
      </p>
<table class="ForrestTable" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4">
        
<tr>
          
<td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>+1</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            "Yes," "Agree," or "the action should be
            performed." In general, this vote also indicates a willingness
            on the behalf of the voter to assist with "making it happen".
          </td>
        
</tr>

<td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>+0</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            This vote indicates a willingness for the action under
            consideration to go ahead. The voter, however will not be able
            to help.
          </td>

<td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>-0</strong></td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            This vote indicates that the voter does not, in general, agree with

            All vetoes must
            contain an explanation of why the veto is appropriate. Vetoes with
            no explanation are void. It may also be appropriate for a -1 vote
            to include an alternative course of action.

</table>
<p>
        All participants in the project are encouraged to show their
        preference for a particular action by voting. When the votes are
        tallied, only the votes of PMC members are binding. Non-binding
        votes are still useful to enable everyone to understand the
        perception of an action by the wider community.
      </p>
<p>
        Voting can also be applied to changes made to the project codebase. These
        typically take the form of a veto (-1) in reply to the commit message
        sent when the commit is made.

          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            Some actions require a 2/3 majority of active PMC members.
            Such actions typically affect the foundation
            of the project (e.g. adopting a new codebase to replace an existing
            product). The higher threshold is designed to ensure such changes
            are strongly supported. To pass this vote requires at least 2/3 of
            binding vote holders to vote +1

<h3 class="underlined_5">Vetoes</h3>
<p>
        A valid veto cannot be over-ruled, it can only be withdrawn by its issuer.
        Any veto must be accompanied by reasoning and be prepared to defend it.
      </p>
<p>
        The validity of a veto, if challenged, can be confirmed by anyone who
        has a binding vote. This does not necessarily signify agreement with the
        veto - merely that the veto is valid. In case of disputes about whether
        a veto is valid, then opinion of the PMC chair is final.
      </p>
<p>
        If you disagree with a valid veto, then you must engage the person
        casting the veto to further discuss the issues. The vetoer is obliged
        to vote early and to then work with the community to resolve
        the matter.
      </p>
<p>
        If a veto is not withdrawn, the action that has been vetoed must
        be reversed in a timely manner.

<h3 class="underlined_5">Voting timeframes</h3>
<p>
        Votes are open for a period of one week to allow all active voters
        time to consider the vote. If the vote has not achieved a quorum,
        then it can be extended for another week. If still no quorum, then
        the vote fails, and would need to be raised again later.
        Votes relating to code changes are not subject to a strict timetable,
        but should be made as timely as possible.
      </p>
<a name="N10292"></a><a name="procedure"></a>
<h3 class="underlined_5">Voting procedure</h3>
<p>
        Discussion about the topic would have already happened in a [Proposal]
        email thread to express the issues and opinions. The [Vote] thread is
        to ratify the proposal.
      </p>
<p>
        The instigator sends the Vote email to the dev mailing list.
        Describe the issue with no ambiguity and in a positive sense.
      </p>
<p>
        Votes are expressed by replying email using the
        <a href="#voting">voting symbols</a> defined above.
        Voters can change their vote during the timeframe.
        At the end of the vote period, the instigator tallies the number of
        final votes and reports the results.
      </p>
<a name="N102A6"></a><a name="ultimatum"></a>
<h3 class="underlined_5">Ultimatum and breakdown</h3>
<p>
        For breakdown situations and those requiring unanimous consensus,
        if this consensus cannot be reached within the extended timeframe,
        then the Board expects the chair to act as the officer of the
        Foundation and make the ultimate decision.

Mention the "Contributer License Agreement".
Who needs to send it? ... is it committers plus major contributers?
