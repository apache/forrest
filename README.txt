This is the Forrest website.

After building the site with 'forrest', copy the relevant documents
from build/site to here, then add and commit.

It is not being used yet - awaiting setup of /www/forrest.apache.org/
We are still using the cvs:xml-site/targets/forrest/ which publishes to
the old /www/xml.apache.org/forrest/
