<p>Forrest is an XML standards-oriented documentation framework
        based on Apache Cocoon, providing XSLT stylesheets and schemas, images
        and other resources. Forrest uses these to render the XML source
        content into a website via command-line, robot, or a dynamic web
        application.

        Forrest is designed with the new user in mind.  Much effort has gone
        into making the process of generating a new site <strong>easy</strong> and
        <strong>simple</strong>:
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>
<strong>Step 1</strong>: Type <span class="codefrag">'forrest seed'</span>, to populate
          the directory with template site structure and contents.</li>
        
<li>
<strong>Step 2</strong>: Add content by editing docs in
          task-specific, presentation-neutral XML.</li>
        
<li>
<strong>Step 3</strong>: Type <span class="codefrag">'forrest'</span> to generate a
          complete website from the XML. Various website styles (known as skins)
          are available, and custom skins can be developed.</li>
      
</ul>
<div class="frame note">
<div class="label">Note</div>
<div class="content">For more information on Forrest installation and use, see the 
      <a href="docs/your-project.html">Using Forrest</a> guide.
      </div>
</div>
<p>
        Forrest's focus on low "startup cost" makes it ideal for rapid
        development of small sites, where time and budget constraints do not
        allow time-wasting HTML experiments. Of course, that same methodology
        can be applied to large projects.
        Your development team does not need Java experience or even XML skills,
        to use Forrest. The framework lets you concentrate on content and design.
      </p>
<p>
        By <strong>separating content from
          presentation</strong>, providing <strong>content templates</strong>
        and <strong>pre-written skins</strong>, Forrest is unequalled at enabling
        content producers to get their message out fast.  This separation of
        concerns makes Forrest excellent
        to publish <strong>project documentation</strong> (notably software projects),
        <strong>intranets</strong>, and <strong>home pages</strong>,
        and anything else you can think of.

        Forrest is far from a quick and dirty solution however.  Forrest is
        built on one of the world's leading XML application frameworks, 
        <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/">Apache Cocoon</a>, which provides advanced
        users with extremely powerful publishing capabilities.
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>Multiple task-specific source XML formats can be used
         (<a href="howto/">How-To</a>,
          <a href="faq.html"><acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</acronym></a>,
          <a href="changes.html">changelogs</a> and
          <a href="todo.html">todo lists</a> supported natively).
          Source formats include: Apache xdocs xml format, plain html
          documents, some Wiki formats, a subset of DocBook, ...
        </li>
        
<li>Multiple output formats supported, for example HTML and PDF (using
          <a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</a>).
        </li>
        
<li>SVG to PNG rendering (using <a href="http://xml.apache.org/batik/">Apache
            Batik</a>); simply drop a SVG in the appropriate directory and it
          will be rendered as PNG.</li>
        
<li>
          Transparent inclusion and aggregation of external content, like
          <a href="changes.rss">RSS feeds</a>.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Anything else possible with the
          <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/concepts/sitemap.html">Cocoon sitemap</a>.  Using database
          queries, <a href="http://www.apache.org/~vgritsenko/stats/index.html">charting</a>, web services
          integration; the possibilities are constantly growing as Cocoon grows.
          See the <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/features.html">Cocoon Features</a> list
          for the full suite of capabilities.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Based on Java, Forrest is platform-independent, making for a
          documentation system that is just as portable as the XML data it
          processes.

<div class="skinconf-heading-2">
<h2>Static or Dynamic</h2>
</div>
<p>
          Unique amongst comparable documentation tools, Forrest generates
          sites that can run both <strong>interactively</strong> as a dynamic
          web application, or as statically rendered pages.
        </p>
<p>
          This provides a path for site growth: start off small and static, and
          if dynamic features (user login, forms processing, runtime data, site
          search etc) are one day needed, these can be accommodated by switching
          to webapp mode.
        </p>
<p>
          Running as a webapp has a major advantage during development:
          content can be written, and
          then the rendered output viewed almost instantly in a web browser.
          This <a href="docs/your-project.html#webapp">webapp technique</a>
          enables Forrest's edit/review cycle to be faster than command-line
          transformation tools.

<div class="section">
<p>Forrest was started in January 2002, with the major use-case being to
        create a consistent and efficient 
        <a href="http://xml.apache.org/">xml.apache.org</a> group of project
        websites with a
        uniform, lightweight, easy-to-navigate layout and structure.  In
        addition, Forrest was to be a Sourceforge-like project management
        tool, complementing <a href="http://gump.apache.org/">Apache Gump</a> (hence
        the name 'Forrest').
      </p>
<p>
        The focus shifted for Forrest to primarily be a generic documentation
        tool capable of meeting many needs. Certain relevant project management
        facilities are being added.

<p>Forrest is currently progressing rapidly through a series of 0.x
        releases. It is certainly usable now (despite not yet being version 1.x).
         See the growing list of

         Many Apache sites.

<p>
        In general, prior to 1.0, ensuring quality of design will be considered
        more important than retaining backwards-compatibility.  Users
        (particularly those with custom sitemaps and skins) should be aware that
        this is evolving software, and read the release notes carefully before
        upgrading.  That said, we appreciate the commitment in time that
        adopters make, and will not make capricious or undocumented
        backwards-incompatible changes.

          The documentation on the Forrest website relates to the current

        Forrest is fairly new, and is in need of developers.  If you know (or
        want to learn) XML, Ant, HTML or CSS, then you are qualified to help!
      </p>
<p>
        As with all Apache projects, Forrest is a meritocracy; the more you
        put in, the more you get to define the project's future.  See the
