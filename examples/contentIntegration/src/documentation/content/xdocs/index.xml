      <title>Early Days</title>
      <p>This example site can take TEI xml or xdoc as an input format, and output it as ODT format. (Actually any page on this site can be output as ODT format)
      </p>
      <p>This site is also an example of a dispatcher themed enabled site in action. Currently it is using the 'maven' type theme. The 'maven' theme is also a work in progress, it look similar to a maven generated site but there are still a few tweaks that can be done.
      </p>
      <p>If you have OpenOffice.org 2.3+ then you can <a href="index.odt">view this xdoc page in OpenOffice</a>. The samples section has a TEI and document-v20 xml file that can be viewed as HTML or downloaded as ODT, <a href="samples/index.html">take a look.</a>
