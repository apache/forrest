            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>This area contains some example documents, some are local, some are remote to try and be varied. The last section contains instructions on how
                    to request random remote addresses via the address bar of your browser. We welcome more examples and also feedback on how they are working
                    for you.</p>
            <p>Check out the How To sections (links on the left navigation) for more detailed instructions on how to construct your own remote document requests.</p>

            <ul>

             <p>Some remote content examples :-</p>

               <li>Something else...</li>
       </ul>
       <note>Remote documents need to be processed 'on the fly' for displaying, so you will notice a delay - this is normal.</note>
        </section>
    <section id="remote">
      <title>Requesting remote documents.</title>
      <p>Currently, requesting remote documents are limited to the 'resources' area of the <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk">OSSWatch site</a>. This limitation
      is mainly by choice; combined with some instructions in the How To section, we aim to expand our choices and help you to be able to do the same.</p>
      <section id="remote_osswatch_resources">
              <title>Remote resources from OSSWatch</title>
              <p>In our sites locationamp.xml file we have chosen a match so that requests made to /osswatch/resources/ will go and retrieve those requests from http://www.osswatch.ac.uk/resources/ and bring them back to Forrest for further processing. That further processing could be 'display in my current site as a regular HTML file' or if an .odt extension is specified it means 'convert to ODT format and allow download for displaying in OpenOffice' (or a number of other things).</p>
              <p>So, go ahead and request a document from the OSSWatch resources area. If you are running this site in localhost then your address bar would end up looking something like <code>http://localhost:8888/osswatch/resources/beginners.html</code>.</p>
      </section>
<note label="Hint">By requesting any of the above documents with the <code>.odt</code> extension, we can bypass HTML viewing and download direct for opening into OpenOffice.org Writer.</note>
