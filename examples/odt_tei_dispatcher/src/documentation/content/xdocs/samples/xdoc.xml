                        <p>This is a sample TEi document</p>

                        <p>You are welcome to add more content to this page to enhance the example. The more that can be put here
                                the more that the TEI input plugin can be tested. Also, output plugins such as the OOo output plugin can
                                also be tested to render TEI -> XDOC -> ODT.</p>
