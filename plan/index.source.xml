      <p>
        This is a collection of notes to assist with certain project planning
        and to co-ordinate development.
        When the development work is complete, then these docs can be removed
        because all of the content will have moved into the documentation proper.
      </p>

        information. Try to keep these notes, and the issues, as concise as possible.
