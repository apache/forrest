  <title>Apache Forrest issue tracker</title>
</header>
<body>

  <section id="intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    The Apache Forrest uses an issue tracker call Jira. All of the project
    contributions should go there (not to the mailing list). This enables us to
    keep track of contributions and to classify and manage the issues.
  </p>

  <p>
    <link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR">http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR</link>
    is the main entry point which provides access to enter, view, search, and
    add additional comments to issues. There are some additional search
    <link href="#filters">filters</link> provided below.
  </p>

  <p>
    You need to set up an account there before you can create new issues or
    add comments to existing issues.
    Anyone can register as a user and report issues.
    See <link href="#guide">guidelines</link> below.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the issue tracker is not a discussion or user help forum.
    Please discuss issues about using Forrest on the user or dev mailing list.
  </p>

  <section id="guide">
    <title>Guidelines and hints for reporting issues</title>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that an issue does not already exist.</li>
      <li>Use Jira's powerful "Find Issues" ability. Set the Project and
        Status fields. See the Help about boolean queries in the Query field.
      </li>
      <li>Follow the prompts below each entry field.</li>
      <li>If you don't know the answer to a particular question, then
        leave the field blank.</li>
      <li>Add a concise initial Description, then add more Comments later to
        further describe the issue.</li>
      <li>Other people will follow up and enhance your description and
        classifications.</li>
      <li>If details about your computing environment are relevant
        (e.g. Java version or operating system) then add them to a Comment.</li>
    </ul>

    <section id="priority">
      <title>Special fields: Priority (a.k.a. Severity)</title>
      <p>
        The Priority is the severity according to the issue reporter. This will
        be a guideline to the development team to identify the most urgent
        issues. It is not a guarantee that a Critical issue will be resolved
        before a Major issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow the Jira help icon to see the definition of the options.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="urgency">
      <title>Special fields: Urgency</title>
      <p>
        The project team will classify this according to their urgency. The aim is
        to be able to see at a glance which issues should be attended to, so that
        developers can operate efficiently and so that the product can be released
        as soon as possible. Some issues hinder the project, so need to be identified.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use the following definition of the options.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          None: The default. Not yet classified.
        </li>
        <li>
          Blocker: Prevents other developers from working; or critical issue with functionality;
          or holds up the implementation of other functionality.
          Cannot release until it is fixed. Will be fixed ASAP.
        </li>
        <li>
          Urgent: Is a key new feature; or affects many users. Will be fixed before the next
          release.
        </li>
        <li>
          Normal: If this issue scratches the itch of any particular developer, then
          they should help to solve it and provide a patch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Low: If this issue bothers you, then fix it because it is not a high priority
          for the project.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

  <section id="filters">
    <title>Some search filters</title>
    <p>
      Various general searches are available from the
      <link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR">front page</link>,
      e.g. "open issues classified by component", or "Added recently".
      The following are some special filters.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=12310472">FOR-open-with-patch</link>
        - Committers need to visit this regularly and deal with the patches.
      </li>
      <li>

        Of course it will include FOR-open-with-patch.
