        Please see our Jira
        <link href="site:bugs">issue tracker</link> for tasks to be done.
        Note that the Todo list below is old. We need someone to move those
        tasks over to the issue tracker.

        Rework the menu generation system to make it more flexible.  See thread

        Define an 'object model' for Forrest sites, in the form of a Cocoon
        pipeline, that defines
        - The directory structure of a site
        - Site metadata (what currently lives in skinconf.xml + gump.xml
         stuff)
        - Perhaps site.xml metadata for pages?
        
        This info can then be made public to the sitemap (via XMLFileModule
        attributes) and the stylesheets (through
        <code>document(cocoon:/...)</code> calls or inlined with source XML).

          Finalise the project-definition DTDs, like status.xml and module.xml;
          try to come up with a common format with others on community.at.apache.org.

          Enhance the initial forrest toolbar for Mozilla.
          See email discussion <link href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=forrest-dev&amp;m=102471820523388">draft forrest toolbar for Mozilla</link>.

          Fix things so docs can be edited in src/*, and have the changes appear
          immediately in the webapp.  Involves creating/using an InputModule for
          passing 'forrest.skin' and other properties to the sitemap, so we can
          avoid the @skin@ hack, and a bit of forrest.build.xml hacking.  There
          are some @tokens@ in a forrest-site CSS file that also need some sort
          of in-place modification.  Perhaps a @token@-to-value Transformer could
          be the same ${variable}-to-value Transformer mentioned in the RT [3].

          Act on <link href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=104099660500001&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">'Entities in XML docs' RT</link>.
          I can implement Stefano's
          suggested solution quite easily, but is such limited functionality
          worth the cost of introducing a proprietary ${variable} syntax? Maybe..
          Best short-term alternative seems to be using the XNI XInclude
          processor for pre-validation inclusion.

          A lot of the info on the website is outdated.

          Using metadata
          from site.xml, it would at least be possible to indicate how old the
          doc is, and perhaps indicate its relevance from a small controlled
          vocabulary.

          Develop a mechanism for supporting legacy URLs.

          Migrate to a decent schema language, primarily so that we can use
          namespaces in XML docs, allowing things like XInclude, 
          <link href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/10/30/rdf-friendly.html">in-line metadata</link>,
          in-line SVG, Jelly snippets, or anything else users can make a
          Transformer for.
         &#8594; open</li><li><strong>[code]</strong> 
          Streamline the process of adding support for new schemas.  Ideally we'd
          have an auto-download system, e.g. 'forrest-update docbook' would fetch
          and install the Docbook DTDs, create catalog entries, sitemap mods etc.
