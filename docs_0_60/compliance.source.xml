      <p>
        Forrest is still quite young, so there are known issues.
        Standards compliance is a definite major goal. Please send patches
        for the Forrest skin stylesheets to ensure such compliance.
      </p>

        For your testing, use the Forrestbot generated website, because that

      <p>
        Tested using the W3C HTML Validation Service
        (<link href="http://validator.w3.org/">validator.w3.org</link>). The
        index.html page of Forrest sites will have a link to this validator,
        unless the user has turned this off.

        The "<code>crust</code>" skin (current forrest-0.6-dev)
        validates as HTML 4.0.1

<p>
  There are actually many accessibility issues with the heavy use of
  tables and images. These skins are gradually being improved.

<p>Issues ...</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Priority 1: alt text for images.
  </li>
  <li>Priority 2: 
  <link href="http://bobby.watchfire.com/bobby/html/en/gls/g41.html">Explicitly
      associate form controls and their labels with the LABEL element</link>.
    Perhaps we could have a label hidden with CSS?</li>
  <li>FIXME: need to list other issues here, or attend to them.</li>
</ol>
<note>The forrest-site skin does not have any missing alts. Perhaps Bobby
  does not like the trick with empty alt attributes. However, it only
  complains about the two in the footer, and not about the other 40.</note>
