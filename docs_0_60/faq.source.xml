      <question>
       Which version of Forrest does the website documentation relate to? 
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The documentation on the Forrest website relates to the current
          head development version of the source repository. See

    <faq id="requirements">
      <question>
        What are the system requirements for Forrest?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Forrest includes everything necessary to build and run, except
          of course for Java. In addition to all the Cocoon JARs, Forrest
          includes and uses its own version of Ant. The
          <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/installing/requirements.html">Cocoon requirements</link>
          indicate that Java 1.3+ is required.

    <faq id="maxmemory">
      <question>
        How can I specify the amount of memory to be used by Java?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
         There are two ways to control this.  If you get an OutOfMemoryError when Cocoon is generating pages,
         see the first paragraph.  If you get an OutOfMemoryError when outside of Cocoon (e.g., copying raw
         files), see the second paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
         The <code>maxmemory</code> property in the <code>forrest.properties</code> file controls how much
         memory Cocoon uses. Like many other properties you can copy them from the default configuration at
         <code>src/core/fresh-site/forrest.properties</code>
        </p>
        <p>
         Set the <code>ANT_OPTS</code> environment variable before you run forrest.  The exact value you set
         it to is dependant on your JVM, but something like <code>ANT_OPTS=-Xmx500M</code> will probably work.

    <faq id="PDF-output">
      <question>How can I generate one pdf-file out of
      the whole site or selected pages of the site?</question>
      <answer>
      <p>Add the following entries to your site.xml file:</p>
        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
  <about tab="home" label="About" href="">
 	  ...
    <all_site label="Full HTML" href="wholesite.html"/>    
    <all_sitePDF label="Full PDF" href="wholesite.pdf"/>  
     ...
  </about>]]></source>
       <p>
       In this case the menu labeled "About" will have 2 new items: 
       "Full PDF" and "Full HTML". (See also
       <link href="site:v0.60//howto/pdf-tab">How to create a PDF document for each tab</link>.)
       </p>
       <p>
         This assumes that you use the
         <link href="site:v0.60//linking">site.xml</link> method for your site
         structure and navigation, rather than the old book.xml method.

       <p>You would override <code>
       src/core/context/skins/common/xslt/html/document2html.xsl</code>

      <answer>
      <p>If you have:<code>&lt;version&gt;$Revision: 1.30
      $&lt;/version&gt;</code>The '1.30' will be extracted and
      displayed at the bottom of the page as "version 1.30". See for
      example the bottom of the
      <link href="site:v0.60//your-project"> Using Forrest</link> document.</p>

    <faq id="ignoring_javadocs">
      <question>
        How do I stop Forrest breaking on links to external files that may not
        exist, like javadocs?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This can be done by overriding the <code>cli.xconf</code> config file,
          and defining patterns for URLs to exclude.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means creating a directory <code>src/documentation/conf</code>
          (or wherever <code>${forrest.conf-dir}</code> points) and copying
          <code>$FORREST_HOME/context/WEB-INF/cli.xconf</code> to it.  Then edit
          cli.xconf, and add any exclude sections you require at the end.  The
          default cli.xconf ignores directory links and links containing
          'apidocs' or starting with 'api/':
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
   ....
   <!-- Includes and excludes can be used to limit which URLs are rendered -->
   ]]><strong><![CDATA[

   <exclude pattern="**apidocs**"/>
   <exclude pattern="api/**"/>
   ]]></strong><![CDATA[
   <uri src="favicon.ico"/>
</cocoon>]]></source>
        <p>This is just an example, and you should modify it appropriately for
          your site.</p>
        <note>
          Wildcards may be used.  These are a powerful feature of Cocoon's
          <link href="site:v0.60//sitemap-ref">sitemap</link>.
          For example, <strong>foo/*</strong> would match
          <code>foo/bar</code>, but not <code>foo/bar/baz</code>
           &#8212; use <strong>foo/**</strong> to match that.

    <faq id="link_raw">
      <question>How do I link to raw files such as config.txt and brochure.pdf?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Place them in the <code>src/documentation/content</code> directory
          and they will get copied into the output tree where you can link to
          them. You can also have sub-directories there to reflect your xdocs
          tree. See the samples documents when you 'forrest seed' a new
          project for a demonstration of this ability.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, if
         <code>src/documentation/content/xdocs/tools/downloads.xml</code>
         has a <code>&lt;link href="tool.zip"&gt;</code> then put
         <code>tool.zip</code> in the
         <code>src/documentation/content/tools/</code> directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          See the explanation and demonstration of "linking" in your local
          'forrest seed' site.

    <faq id="claimed_patterns">
      <question>Some of my files are not being processed because they use
      common filenames.
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Certain patterns are claimed by the default sitemaps for
          special processing. These include:
          <code>site, changes, todo, faq, images, my-images, skinconf,
          community, howto</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes there are workarounds, e.g. perhaps "my_site".
          In future versions of Forrest we will attempt to deal with this issue.

    <faq id="pdf_images">
      <question>Images don't display in PDFs. How do I fix this?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
	  Forrest uses <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</link>
          for rendering PDFs.  FOP cannot handle all image types natively, and
          requires third-party jars to be added. FOP natively handles BMP, GIF,
	  JPG, TIFF and EPS (with a few limitations). FOP can also handle SVG
	  (via Batik!and PNG (see below). For details, see 
	  <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/graphics.html">FOP Graphics
          formats</link>
        </p>
        <p>To get PNGs working in PDFs with Jimi:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download Jimi from
           <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/">http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/</link></li>
          <li>Unpack the Jimi distribution and copy JimiProClasses.zip to
            <code>$FORREST/lib/optional/jimi-1.0.jar</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternatively you can use JAI (Java Advanced Imaging API at 
	  http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai). For more
          info, see

     <faq id="index.html">
      <question>
        The tab link in my site incorrectly assumes that 'index.html' is present in
        the linked-to directory. How do I fix this?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          In <code>tabs.xml</code>, use @href instead of @dir, and omit the
          trailing '/'. Which file to serve is then a concern of the sitemap.
          For example, if the "User Manual" tab should link to
          <code>manual/Introduction.html</code> then
          <code>tabs.xml</code> should contain:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
  <tab label="User Manual" href="manual"/>]]></source>
        <p>
          and add this rule to the sitemap:

        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
  <map:match pattern="manual">

        There are <link href="site:v0.60//skins">default skins</link> provided,

        See notes about

      <question>How do I enable <acronym title="eXtensible Server Pages">XSP</acronym> processing?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>First consider whether your needs would be better met by Cocoon itself, rather than Forrest.
        </p>
        <p>That said, there are valid reasons for wanting programmatically generated content, so here is how to enable
          XSP:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download 
          <link href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/cocoon-2.1/lib/optional/jdtcore-2.1.0.jar?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=application/java">jdtcore-2.1.0.jar</link>,
            and copy it to the $FORREST_HOME/context/WEB-INF/lib directory
            (or lib/core/ directory in the source
            distribution).</li>
          <li><p>Override sitemap.xmap in your local project (copy $FORREST_HOME/context/sitemap.xmap to
              src/documentation/), and add the following generator definition in the map:generators section:</p>
            <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
  <map:generator name="serverpages"
     pool-grow="2" pool-max="32" pool-min="4"
     src="org.apache.cocoon.generation.ServerPagesGenerator"/>]]></source>
          </li>
          <li><p>Decide how you want to use XSP.  For single files, you could just define a *.xml matcher:</p>
            <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
<map:match pattern="dynamic.xml">
  <map:generate src="content/xdocs/dynamic.xsp" type="serverpages"/>
  ...

    <faq id="breadcrumbs">
      <question>How do breadcrumbs work?  Why don't they work locally?</question>
      <answer>
      <p>Breadcrumbs begin with up to three URLs specified in
      <code>skinconf.xml</code>.  Here is what the Forrest site uses:</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
  <trail>
    <link1 name="apache" href="http://www.apache.org/"/>
    <link2 name="xml.apache" href="http://xml.apache.org/"/>
    <link3 name="" href=""/>
  </trail>]]></source>
      <p>If any links are blank, they are not used.  After these first links,
      JavaScript looks at the URL for the current page and
      makes a link for each directory after the domain.  If you are viewing
      the site locally, there is no domain and so
      there will be no extra breadcrumbs, only the ones that are specified
      in <code>skinconf.xml</code>.

    <faq id="odd_html">
      <question>
        After upgrading to 0.4 my HTML looks significantly different, and table
        widths are wrong. What happened?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Forrest now uses a HTML 4.0.1 <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration:</p>
          <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">]]></source>
        <p>
          This causes browsers to render the page in standards-compliance mode,
          or rather, not in "quirks" mode. For some operations (like determining
          table column widths), quirks mode results in better looking pages.
          For the old pre-0.4 behaviour, create a custom sitemap and remove the
          line:</p>
        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
  <doctype-system>http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd</doctype-system>]]></source>

    <faq id="validation_error-doctype_root_null">
      <question>
        When building my project, I get an validation error: <code>Document root
          element "site", must match DOCTYPE root "null".</code>.
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          You are probably trying to build the project with an old version of
          Forrest (built before 2003-01-08) that is incorrectly trying to validate
          the site.xml file.  If so, please update your Forrest
          installation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you may be building with an up-to-date Forrest, but have
          overridden <code>forrest.validate.xdocs.excludes</code> in
          <code>forrest.properties</code>.  With the introduction of
          site.xml, the above property must have site.xml
          listed to prevent an attempt at DTD-based validation.

    <faq id="generating_menus">
      <question>What is the relationship between site.xml and
        <code>book.xml</code>?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          One site.xml file in your project root can replace all the book.xml files
          (one per directory) in your site.  Internally, Forrest uses site.xml to
          dynamically generate book.xml files.  However, Forrest first checks
          for the existence of a book.xml file, so backwards-compatibility is
          preserved.  If a directory has a book.xml file, the book.xml will be
          used to generate the menu.  This supplement is useful in situations
          where site.xml-generated menus aren't appropriate.

    <faq id="docbook">
      <question>
        How do I use DocBook as the xml documentation format?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
         There are two ways. Forrest can transform the DocBook format into the
         Forrest "xdocs" format on-the-fly and then render that as normal
         Forrest documents.
         Be aware that the stylesheet that does this transformation is
         deliberately very limited and does not attempt to deal with all
         DocBook elements.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other way is to use the full DocBook stylesheets directly. The DocBook
         DTDs are shipped with Forrest and automatically handled. However, you
         will need to have the DocBook stylesheets on your system (they are
         too massive to ship with Forrest) and configure Forrest accordingly.
         You will need to create a
         <link href="site:v0.60//project-sitemap">project sitemap</link>
          as explained in
         <link href="site:v0.60//your-project">Using Forrest</link>
         and add matches to handle your DocBook documents.
         Here is an example. Note that you need to change it to suit your
         situation. The match must be very specific so that only the
         DocBook documents are matched. The rest of the documents will be
         handled by Forrest core. Powerful regex capabilities are available.

</map:sitemap>]]>
        </source>
        <p>
         You can also use a mixture of the two methods, some handled
         automatically by Forrest and some directly using DocBook stylesheets.
         You can also have a mixture of source files as "document-v*" DTD and DocBook.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ensure that the document type declaration in your xml instance is
         well specified. Use a public identifier. The DTD will then be properly
         resolved by Forrest. If you need to use different DTDs, then see
         <link href="site:v0.60//your-project/new_dtd">Using Forrest</link>

        How to report which version of Forrest is being used and the

      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Do <code>'forrest -projecthelp'</code> or <code>'./build.sh'</code>
          to find the version number.
        </p>
        <p>
          To list the properties, add "forrest.echo=true" to your
          forrest.properties file and watch the build messages.
          Doing <code>'forrest -v'</code> will provide verbose build messages.

    <faq id="logs">
      <question>
        Where are the log files to find more infomation about errors?

        <p>
          The logfiles are at <code>build/webapp/WEB-INF/logs/</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          The log level can be raised with the <code>logkit.xconf</code>
          configuration. If you are using Forrest in the interactive webapp
          mode (which is generally easiest for debugging errors) then see the
          <code>build/webapp/WEB-INF/logkit.xconf</code> file.
          If you are generating a static site (with command-line 'forrest')
          then copy <code>$FORREST_HOME/context/WEB-INF/logkit.xconf</code>
          to your project at
          <code>src/documentation/content/conf/logkit.xconf</code>
          and modify it. See more information and efficiency tips with
          <link href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/ExploringTheLogs">Cocoon logging</link>.

        <p>
          Doing <code>'forrest -v'</code> will provide verbose build messages
