        Strip remaining &lt;i18n:text&gt; elements that remain if i18n processing
        has been disabled. This was causing invalid HTML output.

        Refactored the view resolver code of the internal.view plugin. Created an action that
        is doing the same as before the combination of sitemap+xsl. Added 2 java classes to package
        org.apache.forrest.plugin.internal.view.acting:
        1.FallbackResolverAction.java2.FallbackResolverHelper.java

       Removed project.view-defaultView properties and added project.theme-extension instead. The combination
       of project.theme-extension and project.theme is equal to project.view-defaultView.

        Use sets of symbols as xml entities for character replacement.
        There is a core set and each project can define a set.
        For example, use "&amp;myp-t;" to represent the
        project name together with trademark symbol
        "My Project Name&#8482;".
        See FAQ.

        Plugins can now define their own *.xconf file to add configuration 
        information to cocoon.xconf. Simply place your *.xconf file in 
        PLUGIN_HOME/conf/*.xconf. Note that changes to this configuration 
        file will not take effect until Forrest has been restarted.

        New site seeding mechanism. You can now run "forrest seed" as before, or you can run
        "forrest seed-business". The later will ask a number of questions about the site
        being seeded (business name, description etc.) and will create a very simple site
        designed for business. To quickly see the results, i.e. avoid
        answering the questions, do "forrest seedTestBusiness". More seed sites will be added
        in the future.

        Added support for a locationmap. This enables content to be retrieved from a location
        that is defined in a locationmap file (located at 
        PROJECT_HOME/src/documentation/content/locationmap.xml file. The
        advantage of this is that the URL seen by the user need bear no relation to the location
        of the source document, thus Forrest can separate the client URL space from the source
        docuement URL space. Thus, using the locationmap it is possible to pull together
        documents from many different locations into a single uniform site.
        
        In addition, since the user URL space is now unconnected to the source URL space
        it is possible to move source documents without breaking any existing user links.
        
        See locationmap docs for more information.
