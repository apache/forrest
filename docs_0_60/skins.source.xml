      <p>
        Forrest supplies a collection of default skins which are configurable
        and so should meet the needs of most projects. The aim is to provide
        many capabilities so that extra skins are not needed.

      <title>Convention for choosing skin names</title>
      <p>
        The skin names are based on playing with the word "skin". See our
        technique for
        <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/src/core/context/skins/new-skin-names.txt">choosing skin names</link>.
        A name with "-dev" extension signifies that it is under development.
        There is no concept of versions of default skins.
        New skins have new names.

        <title>pelt</title>
        <p>
          Uses CSS "div" and no HTML tables.
          During its earlier development, this skin used to be called "css-style-dev".

        <title>leather-dev</title>
        <p>
          This is the evolution of the "pelt" skin, to have naming
          conventions for css elements. It is still in development.

      <section id="tigris">
        <title>tigris</title>
        <p>
          This skin is based on version 1.1 of the 
          <link href="http://style.tigris.org/">style.tigris.org</link> project.
          (It deliberately contravenes our skin naming convention.)

      <section id="plain-dev">
        <title>plain-dev</title>
        <p>
          This is a very minimal skin to produce plain HTML documents.
          Such capability might be useful to generate a collection of
          documents for some off-line product's user help system.

        The following skins are retained for a little while longer, but are
        deprecated, so please move to one of the other skins.

      <section id="forrest-site">
        <title>forrest-site</title>
        <p>
          This is the old skin that we have been dragging around since early
          days. Uses HTML tables.
