      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
      This page describes changes to Apache Forrest that affect people who are
      upgrading to the 0.6 version.
      If you have other issues, then please discuss on either the
      <link href="site:mail-lists/forrest-dev">dev</link> or
      <link href="site:mail-lists/forrest-user">user</link>
      mailing lists.
      As more experience is gained, this document will be updated.  
      </p>
      
    </section>

    <section id="new">
      <title>New Features</title>
      <p>
        The following list shows some of the key new features for Forrest 0.6
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copyless, so now used in place.</li>
        <li>Project sitemaps take precedence.</li>
        <li>Now using Subversion (SVN) for source control.</li>
        <li>New skinconf capabilities and new external skinconf DTD.</li>
        <li>New skins use CSS instead of tables. Old skins deprecated.</li>
        <li>Forrestbot.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="clean">
      <title>Run a clean target after upgrade</title>
      <p>To avoid any issue with old classes being loaded, run a
        '<code>forrest clean</code>' in your project directory, after you
        upgraded to this version.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="sync">
      <title>General upgrade tips</title>
      <p>
      Synchronise your project's skinconf.xml and forrest.properties files.
      </p>
      <p>
      Take advantage of the separation of concerns. In a new workspace,
      create a fresh
      '<code>forrest seed</code>' site, then tweak its forrest.properties
      and skinconf.xml until it reflects your old site.
      When it is ready, replace your project's skinconf.xml and
      forrest.properties files.
      Any remaining issues would concern other aspects of your configuration,
      such as site.xml and your actual content.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="home">
      <title>New location of $FORREST_HOME</title>
      <p>
      To use the new Forrest, run 'build.sh' or 'build.bat' as normal,
      then change the FORREST_HOME environment variable to point to
      forrest/src/core instead of the old forrest-0.5 location
      (.../build/dist/shbat). Also make sure PATH gets updated to use the new 
      $FORREST_HOME/bin
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="copyless">
      <title>Copyless</title>
      <p>
      In essence, Forrest does not create a dist anymore, and uses 
      itself in place. No more useless copying to a separate build space,
      no more backcopying of your changes, all is used live.
      </p>
      <p>
      It improves the build process a lot. Development turnaround time is
      excellent. You can even tweak the main forrest core stylesheets and
      see changes immediately.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="sitemap">
      <title>Project sitemaps take precedence.</title>

      <p>With Forrest 0.6 it is now possible for projects to "plugin" 
      to our sitemaps, without needing to copy the main sitemaps and keep
      them synchonised. This will enable hassle-free update to
      future Forrest versions.</p>

      <p>
        If your old project did not use any customised <code>*.xmap</code> 
        files, then your upgrade process will be easy (you can safely skip this
        section).</p>
        
      <p>If your project did use custom <code>*.xmaps</code>, with matchers for 
        special circumstances (for example special doctypes that you 
        were handling) then you will need to be prepared to make some changes. 
        Hopefully with the new functionality of Forrest, you can do away with 
        your customisations altogether and just use the Forrest default 
        sitemaps. Try that first. If not, then read on...</p>
        
      <p>Prior to 0.6 it was possible to replace *any* of the xmaps by placing 
      your own versions in your project directory, these were then copied over 
      to replace
      the Forrest ones at build time. However, with the move to 
      <link href="#copyless">copyless</link> this no longer happens, instead 
      there is now an extension mechanism for the sitemap (as opposed to 
      a replacement mechanism).</p>

      <p>When upgrading to Forrest 0.6 you need to copy customised matchers 
      in any of your projects <code>*.xmap</code> files into your projects 
      <code>sitemap.xmap</code> file. Any matchers in your project 
      <code>*.xmap</code> files that duplicate ones in Forrests own 
      <code>*.xmaps</code> can now be removed. This will ensure that future 
      enhancements to these matchers in Forrest will automatically be included 
      in your project.</p>

      <p>Move your old sitemap out of the way, copy a default one from a fresh
      'forrest seed', and add the specific matches that you require.</p>
      
      <p>The good news is that this process makes upgrading to future versions
      of Forrest much simpler, because your project <code>*.xmap</code> files will 
      contain only your customisations. As a result there will no longer be a
      need to merge your custom xmaps with the updated ones in upcoming versions of 
      Forrest.</p>
      
      <p>See <link href="site:v0.60//project-sitemap">Using project 
      sitemaps</link> for more details.</p>
        
    </section>

    <section id="skin-config-1">
      <title>Private skins might need changes to document2html.xsl</title>
      <p>
      Moved all references to //skinconfig out of the document2html.xsl
      into the site2xhtml.xsl file. If you have your own skins that were
      referencing "$config" or "//skinconfig" in the document2html.xsl
      then you need to make similar changes.
      For further information, see Issue
      <link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?key=FOR-146">FOR-146</link>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="skin-config-2">
      <title>Various additions to skin configuration and new external DTD</title>
      <p>
      Various capabilities have been added to the skinconfig.
      See the new descriptions in the 
      '<code>forrest seed</code>' site
      <code>src/documentation/skinconf.xml</code> and synchronise yours.
      </p>
      <p>For example, to use different colors (e.g. the light blue of the old
      krysalis skin), CSS colors can be specified in skinconf.xml
      </p>
      <p>
      There is now an external DTD which makes it much easier to keep your
      skinconf.xml synchronised.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="antproxy">
      <title>forrest.antproxy.xml is obsolete in favor of Ant's &lt;import&gt; task</title>
      <p>
      Projects that use <code>forrest.antproxy.xml</code> via an Ant build
      task to invoke Forrest, will receive
      an error message directing them to this document.
      Please see the <link href="site:v0.60//your-project/invoking_from_ant">Invoking
      Forrest from Ant</link> documentation for instructions on how to use
      the &lt;import&gt; task to integrate Forrest with your build system.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ehtml">
      <title>Deprecation of .ehtml and .ihtml</title>
      <p>
      The .ehtml input file format has been deprecated and will likely be
      removed in the next release.
      Please convert all .ehtml files to .html files.
      If you do '<code>forrest seed</code>' there is a sample html source file.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="jspwiki">
      <title>Deprecation of .cwiki filename extension to become .jspwiki</title>
      <p>
      Use the .jspwiki filename extension rather than old .cwiki extension.
      Clarifies that the purpose is the JSPWiki source format.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="forrestbot">
      <title>New forrestbot</title>
      <p>
      The forrestbot and the forrestbot web interface have been completely
      rewritten.  There is no
      direct way to convert old configurations to new configurations.
      Please see the <link href="site:forrestbot">forrestbot
      documentation</link> for instructions to create buildfiles that work
      with the new forrestbot.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="dtd">
      <title>New DTDs</title>
      <p>
      Updated all v1.2 DTDs to become v1.3 DTDs (forward compatibility:
      v1.2 docs will work fine as V1.3). The main change is the addition
      of a @class attribute to every element, which enables the "extra-css"
      section in the skinconf to be put to good use.
      </p>
      <p>
      Updated the v2.0a DTDs to become v2.0 DTDs (forward incompatibility:
      v1.2/1.3 docs are not forward-compatible as V2.0).

    <section id="catalog">
      <title>SystemIdentifiers for DTDs changed to forrest.apache.org</title>
      <p>
        Everyone should still continue to use the
        <link href="site:v0.60//catalog">Catalog Entity Resolver</link>
        and that certainly still operates at the core of Forrest using the
        well-defined PublicIdentifiers.
        However, some impoverished XML tools do not, so they need to be able
        to get the DTDs from the website. Some other tools rely on the System
        Identifier rather than the Public Identifer. See Forrest Issue
        <link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?key=FOR-107">FOR-107</link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In previous versions of Forrest, and maybe in your application if
        you copied the fresh-site xdocs, there were inconsistent
        SystemIdentifiers. Some used local filenames, others used
        apache.org/forrest/dtd/ URIs. In v0.6 we changed to use
        System Identifiers at forrest.apache.org/dtd/ as resource URLs.
        You do not need to change them because you are using the entity
        resolver, but to remain consistent, it probably is best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beware if you have a catalog where the mapping is not declared properly.
        The Catalog Entity Resolver will miss the local mapping and happily
        go to the network to get the DTDs. That would cause Forrest to appear
        to be slow for you, yet it will still operate properly. While we are
        on that topic, if you use the XSLT document() function - there is a 
        <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28341">Xalan bug 28341</link>
        for DTD resolution via document() - please help to fix it.
        Also see the 
        <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/faq/faq-xslt.html">Cocoon FAQ</link>.

    </section>

    <section id="local-catalog">
      <title>Projects can use a local CatalogManager.properties</title>
      <p>
      You can add a local CatalogManager.properties to your 
      project.classes-dir (usually src/documentation/classes/)
      to define your additional catalogs for DTDs and other entities.
      Copy a default file from a fresh 'forrest seed site'.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you do not add such a configuration file, then there will be a
      harmless message on startup "CatalogManager.properties not found".
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="skin-names">
      <title>Skins renamed and deleted</title>
      <p>Skins now have a naming convention. The default skins are
      <link href="skins.html">described</link>.</p>
      <p>The old skin names are automatically mapped to the new names. You
      should change your forrest.properties to use the new names.</p>
      <p>The following skins were renamed (the old names still work, but may not in future releases).</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.5 Name</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.6 Name</th></tr>
        <tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">krysalis-site</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">crust</td></tr>
        <tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">tigris-style</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">tigris</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>The following skins were deleted (the old names still work, but may not in future releases).</p>

      </table>
      <p>The old "forrest-site" skin is retained for a little while longer,
        but is deprecated, so please move to one of the other skins.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="wholesite">
      <title>Wholesite.html/pdf</title>
      <p>Instead of using names "site.html/pdf" to create an aggregate page
       of your entire site, use "wholesite.html/pdf". The old names are still
       supported for backwards compatibility but they may not be in the
       future.</p>
