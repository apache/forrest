             Getting Forrest's Cocoon Sources
             --------------------------------

Getting the complete sources for the Cocoon version used in
Forrest is a bit complex since we are using an old known revision
of Coccoon trunk that uses some externals.

Here is how to get the complete sources

> 1. checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cocoon/trunk in rev 351990
>
> 2. checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cocoon/blocks (i used rev 
> 351990 - rev. number changed automaticaly)
> (into folder cocoon/src/blocks)
>
> 3. checkout 
> http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/gump/metadata/project/cocoon/module.xml 
> in rev 351990
> (into folder cocoon/src/gump/)
>
> 4. copy local.build.properties and local.blocks.properties from
> apache-forrest-0.8/etc/cocoon_upgrade into cocoon/
>
> 5. build cocoon
