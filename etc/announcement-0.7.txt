Subject: [Announce] Apache Forrest 0.7

Note: This development version may differ from the final announcement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache Forrest is pleased to release the new version: apache-forrest-0.7
http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi

Apache Forrest is a publishing framework that transforms
input from various sources into a unified presentation
in one or more output formats. The modular and extensible
plugin architecture is based on Apache Cocoon and relevant
standards, which separates presentation from content.
Forrest can generate static documents, or be used as a
dynamic server, or be deployed by its automated facility.

New features in this version include:

* An architecture for Plugins which enables a smaller Forrest
core and the ability to add new features in a modular way.
