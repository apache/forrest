To publish from site-author and/or docs-author:

Do once:
# create $FORREST_HOME/deploy.svn.settings which looks like:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project>
  <property name="deploy.svn.user" value="myApacheUsername"/>
  <property name="deploy.svn.user" value="myPassword"/>
</project>


# Make changes to source & commit.
# forrest -f publish.xml build
# verify files in build/forrest-[docs|site]
# forrest -f publish.xml deploy -Ddeploy.svn.commit-message="my commit message"

Now the files are in SVN at forrest/site
Periodically the real website files are updated from there.
You do not have to do anything else.

-----------------------

To publish documentation from a non-trunk branch:

# check out the branch (e.g. svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/branches/forrest_07_branch)
# make sure $FORREST_HOME is set (it uses this to find deploy.svn.settings)
# Do the steps above within this branch

-----------------------

To publish documentation from the 0.6 branch:

(this is unique because it does not have split docs/site, but currently we still need to publish it)

# cd forrest_06_branch
# forrest -f publish_docs.xml build
# forrest -f publish_docs.xml deploy -Ddeploy.svn.commit-message="my commit message"
