                Release Notes for Apache Forrest 0.9

Apache Forrest is pleased to release the new version: apache-forrest-0.9
========================================================================

  It can be downloaded from one of the Apache Software Foundation mirror 
  sites [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi]. 

  Apache Forrestâ„¢ software is a publishing framework that transforms 
  input from various sources into a unified presentation in one or more 
  output formats. The modular and extensible plug-in architecture of 
  Apache Forrest is based on Apache Cocoon and the relevant industry 
  standards that separate presentation from content. Forrest can generate 
  static documents, or be used as a dynamic server, or be deployed by its 
  automated facility. 

Requirements
============

  A Java Runtime Environment (1.5 or higher) installed. 

  To build from source requires a Java Development Kit (1.5 or higher) 

  Apache Ant is not required: Forrest uses its own packaged version of 
  Ant in tools/ant/ 

  Apache Cocoon is not required: Forrest uses its own packaged version. 

Installing Apache Forrest
=========================

  The distribution contains all Forrest resources (skins, XSLTs, images, 
  schemas), source code, and Forrest's own website documentation. 

  Copy somewhere permanent, like /usr/local/forrest or c:\forrest 
  (Support for installation on Windows systems into directories 
  containing spaces is very new, please report back on your success or 
  failure.) 

  Set FORREST_HOME environment variable to point to that top-level 
  directory. 

  Add to the system PATH environment variable, i.e. $FORREST_HOME/bin 
  (Unix) or %FORREST_HOME%\bin (Windows) 

Getting Started
===============

  See the file index.html for the quick start tips.

============================

                                  ** Note **
  This is not a complete list of changes, just some of the more important 
  ones. A full list of changes in this release is available
  [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/changes.html]. 
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Changes to Build
  ----------------

    * [Icon: update] Forrest minimum Java version is now Java 1.5 required 
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/faq.html#requirements]
      starting with Forrest-0.9-dev Committed by GM.

  Changes to the Code Base
  ------------------------

    * [Icon: fix] Suppress extra generated id when converting xdoc sections 
      to html. See upgrading notes
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/upgrading_09.html]. 
      Committed by BMD.
    * [Icon: update] Replaced the custom caching implementation with EHCache 
      in the LocationMap feature. Given how integral the LM has become, this 
      gives us much better overall performance, concurrent behavior, and 
      cache configuration options. Added a default cache config file to 
      main/webapp/WEB-INF/ehcache.xml Committed by TWW. See Issue FOR-1031 
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1031].
    * [Icon: add] Enabled use of EXSLT extensions via exslt.org stylesheets. 
      See example "EXSLT" in the 'forrest seed-sample' site. Committed by DC. 
      See Issue FOR-1176
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1176].
    * [Icon: add] Enabled the filtering of output messages from Ant (see FAQ 
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/faq.html#verbose-ant])
      and explained how to enable coloured output (see FAQ
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/faq.html#coloured-ant]). 
      Committed by DC. See Issue FOR-1178
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1178].
    * [Icon: add] Added a demonstration of using xml source documents without 
      declaring a DTD. See example "no-dtd" in the 'forrest seed-sample' 
      site. Committed by DC. See Issue FOR-1173
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1173].
    * [Icon: add] Added the ability to use RELAXNG to validate intermediate 
      xml. Do 'localhost:8888/index.validation.xml' for example to validate 
      the "index" page. Also see how to validate intermediate
      content for the whole site. 
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/howto-dev.html#validate-intermediate]
      Committed by DC. See Issue FOR-1172
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1172].
    * [Icon: add] Added the ability for a "trademark statement" at bottom of 
      all pages. For configuration details, see skinconf.xml from a new 
      "seed" site. Committed by DC. See Issue FOR-1170
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1170].
    * [Icon: fix] There was a problem with plugins libs not being copied. 
      Using the war task from ant fixes this issue. Committed by TS. See 
      Issue FOR-1074
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1074].
    * [Icon: fix] Enabled the output html serializer to be configurable to 
      either xhtml or html. Committed by DC. See Issue FOR-1156
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1156].
    * [Icon: update] Updated to Jing release
      [Link: http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/]).
      As well as providing us with a 
      reliable RELAX NG tool, this upgrade fixes an issue on some Java 6 with 
      missing datatype library. Committed by DC. See Issue FOR-984
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-984].
    * [Icon: update] Updated to Apache-Ant-1.7.1 release. Also jsch-0.1.28 to 
      jsch-0.1.39 release. Committed by DC.
    * [Icon: update] Our packaged version of Apache Cocoon has been upgraded 
      to use the latest version of their stable 2.1 branch. This is a major 
      step forward for Forrest. It enables us to use a reliable and 
      up-to-date Cocoon. Forrest developers can again participate at Cocoon 
      to fix issues or develop new blocks. A number of major performance 
      issues are already fixed in this version. Also upgraded various other 
      important supporting products such as Apache Xerces and Apache Xalan, 
      etc. See upgrading notes
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/upgrading_09.html#cocoon]. 
      Committed by TS. Thanks to Thorsten Scherler, David Crossley. See Issue 
      FOR-955 [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-955], FOR-1017 
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1017].
    * [Icon: update] Promoting the output.inputModule plugin to core. Main 
      reason for the move is to prevent plugins dependencies since the code 
      has attracted different use cases solved in plugins to move it into 
      core. Committed by TS. See Issue FOR-1103
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1103].
    * [Icon: add] Enable configuration of some Cocoon sitemap components, 
      e.g. output html encoding and document type declaration for html and 
      xhtml serializers, JTidy properties file location for html generator. 
      See FAQ
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/faq.html#sitemap-entities]
      Committed by DC. 
      See Issue FOR-1071
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1071].
    * [Icon: fix] There was a partially implemented xml catalog with missing 
      project symbols file. Only affected users of the 'seed-basic' template 
      site. See notes in upgrading to v0.9
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/upgrading_09.html]
      Committed by DC. See Issue FOR-1075
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-1075].
    * [Icon: update] Images had not been reliably reproduced in PDFs (fop 
      version prior to 0.94). The old way always expected a physical URI 
      (file or http) the new fop URIResolver in the FOP-NG block delegates to 
      Cocoon's SourceResolver framework, meaning images can be the result of 
      a pipeline. Committed by TS. See Issue FOR-635
      [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-635].

  Changes to Documentation
  ------------------------

    * [Icon: add] Added document to facilitate upgrading to v0.9
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/upgrading_09.html] Committed by DC.
    * [Icon: update] Improved the FAQ about "version and properties" and 
      linked to the documentation of the new Properties
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/docs/properties.html] system.
      Committed by DC.
    * [Icon: add] Added an FAQ
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/faq.html#oldjing]
      to try to 
      explain that Forrest does not require Java 6. Committed by DC. See 
      Issue FOR-984 [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-984].
    * [Icon: add] Added new documents: How to deploy documentation with the 
      Forrestbot "svn" workstage
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/howto-forrestbot-svn.html]
      which explains how the Apache Forrest project manages their project 
      documentation, and How to deploy documentation with the Forrestbot 
      "scp" workstage
      [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/howto-forrestbot-scp.html]
      which explains how to 
      manage a personal or company website using Secure Shell SCP to deploy 
      the generated documents. Committed by DC.
