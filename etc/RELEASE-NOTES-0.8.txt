                       Release Notes for Forrest 0.8

Apache Forrest is pleased to release the new version: apache-forrest-0.8
========================================================================

  It can be downloaded from one of the Apache Software Foundation mirror 
  sites [Link: http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi]. 

  Apache Forrest (tm) software is a publishing framework that transforms
  input from various sources into a unified presentation in one or more
  output formats. The modular and extensible plug-in architecture of
  Apache Forrest is based on Apache Cocoon and the relevant industry
  standards that separate presentation from content. Forrest can generate
  static documents, or be used as a dynamic server, or be deployed by its
  automated facility.

Requirements
============

  A Java Runtime Environment (1.4 or higher) installed. 

  To build from source requires a Java Development Kit (1.4 or higher) 

  Apache Ant is not required: Forrest uses its own version of Ant in 
  tools/ant/ 

  Apache Cocoon is not required: Forrest uses its own version. 

Installing Apache Forrest
=========================

  The distribution contains all Forrest resources (skins, XSLTs, images, 
  schemas), source code and Forrest's own website documentation. 

  Copy somewhere permanent, like /usr/local/forrest or c:\forrest 
  (Support for installation on Windows systems into directories 
  containing spaces is very new, please report back on your success or 
  failure.) 

  Set FORREST_HOME environment variable to point to that top-level 
  directory. 

  Add to the system PATH environment variable,
  i.e. $FORREST_HOME/bin (Unix) or %FORREST_HOME%\bin (Windows) 

Getting Started
===============

  See the file index.html for the quick start tips.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Changes to the Code Base
  ------------------------

    * [Icon: fix] Thanks to Gunther Sablon for reporting this issue. Plugins 
      were not being deployed to a Webapp WAR file correctly. Committed by 
      RDG. See Issue FOR-735 [Link: 
      http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-735].
    * [Icon: update] Rename webapp build target to run-webapp to distinguish 
      the resulting webapp from one suitable for deployment (use the war 
      target for that) and provide a new xconf that is used in the war to 
      ensure plugins can be found in war files Committed by RDG. See Issue 
      FOR-735 [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-735].
    * [Icon: fix] Fix caching problem that made a restart neccessary after 
      making a locationmap resource location change. Committed by TWW. See 
      Issue FOR-732 [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-732].
    * [Icon: fix] After doing 'forrest clean' then Forrest could not be run 
      without network access, due to not being able to retrieve plugin 
      descriptor files. Committed by DC. See Issue FOR-927 [Link: 
      http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-927].
    * [Icon: update] FOR-924 Readding the loading from 
      (default-)forrest.properties which got removed in r430588 when closing 
      FOR-916. Thanks Martin Stockhammer for pointing it out, providing us 
      with a patch and for your contribution. Committed by TS. Thanks to 
      Martin Stockhammer. See Issue FOR-924 [Link: 
      http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-924].
    * [Icon: update] FOR-920 Merging the defaults and project modules to the 
      new properties module. You can use it like {properties:forrest.home}, 
      please refer to the update documentation [Link: 
      docs_0_80/upgrading_08.html] how to change your {defaults:*} 
      {project:*} and {forrest:*}. Committed by TS.
    * [Icon: remove] Remove xconf support for plugins. Cocoon has moved away 
      from this XConfToolTask xpatch technique. Diff [Link: 
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=354749&view=rev] Committed by RDG.
    * [Icon: add] Added new "clean" targets. Doing 'forrest clean-site' will 
      remove the contents of the project's generated documents directory. 
      Doing 'forrest clean-work' will remove the project's work directories 
      (usually build/tmp and build/webapp which include the Cocoon cache and 
      the Cocoon logs). Doing 'forrest clean' will remove both sections. 
      Committed by DC.
    * [Icon: add] The broken-links file is now copied into to the site root 
      as "broken-links.xml" so that when building with Forrestbot you can 
      easily view it. Committed by RDG.
    * [Icon: add] Reviewed all sitemaps to use locationmap references (lm:). 
      At the same time we changed filenames of core stylesheets to follow a 
      filename convention (e.g. html2document.xsl => html-to-document.xsl) 
      which enables automated locationmap matches. Thanks to the many people 
      who were involved with addressing this issue. See the commit logs 
      associated with FOR-200. Committed by RDG. Thanks to Community. See 
      Issue FOR-200 [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-200].
    * [Icon: add] Prototype of new xml-based properties system. Projects and
      plugins can use a forrest.properties.xml file. At this stage, it
      supplements the existing forrest.properties file. See the projectInfo
      plugin for an example of its use.
    * [Icon: add] Add notes about naming convention for locationmap 
      references. Gathered from a ForrestFriday IRC session (thanks to Tim 
      Williams for writing them up). See locationmap docs [Link: 
      docs_0_80/locationmap.html]. Committed by RDG. Thanks to Community. See 
      Issue FOR-200 [Link: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-200].
    * [Icon: add] Added support for Locationmaps. This enables content to be 
      retrieved from a location that is defined in a locationmap file. A 
      project-based file can be located at 
      PROJECT_HOME/src/documentation/content/locationmap.xml while core 
      locationmaps are at $FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/locationmap-*.xml 
      files.The advantage of this is that the URL seen by the user need bear 
      no relation to the location of the source document, thus Forrest can 
      separate the client URL space from the source document URL space. Thus, 
      using the locationmap it is possible to pull together documents from 
      many different locations into a single uniform site.In addition, since 
      the user URL space is now unconnected to the source URL space it is 
      possible to move source documents without breaking any existing user 
      links.See locationmap docs [Link: docs_0_80/locationmap.html] for more 
      information. Thanks to Unico Hommes for the original locationmap 
      implementation which was added to Forrest long ago. Committed by RDG.
