      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        On the second Friday of each month we have a 24-hour get-together using
        the dev mailing list, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and other collaborative
        tools, to work on Forrest development and get to know each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        ForrestFriday starts at 06:00 UTC (6am Greenwich Mean Time in London)
        and lasts for 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next event will take place on <strong>10 February 2006</strong>. See 
        <link href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?year=2006&amp;month=02&amp;day=10&amp;hour=6&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0">start time</link>
        and
        <link href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?day=10&amp;month=02&amp;year=2006&amp;p1=136&amp;p2=48&amp;p3=176&amp;p4=240&amp;p5=224&amp;p6=213">zone overlap</link>.

      <title>Purpose</title>
      <p>
        The day is devoted to working collaboratively to solve particular issues
        and getting to know each other. In the weeks leading up to each event,
        decide on the dev mailing list what the main topic should be. Probably
        something that needs groups work (e.g. moving the internal format to
        be XHTML2).
      </p>
      <p>
        There will also be an effort to clean up the
        <link href="site:bugs">Issue Tracker</link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dev mailing list is still the main form of communication and all
        decisions are made there. The IRC channel is to support that and provide
        a place for near real-time discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The IRC channel is definitely not open continuously. It is only for
        temporary communications at this monthly meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a user help forum, please do that on the user mailing list.

      <title>How to participate</title>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All volunteers are welcome.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get an IRC client (some are mentioned at <link href="http://irchelp.org/">irchelp.org</link>)
          and see <link href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html">IRC Tutorial</link>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read the dev mailing list. That is where any decisions will be
          made and the name of the IRC channel will be announced.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the start time, connect to irc.freenode.net and join the channel.
        </li>
        <li>
          The discussion will be logged and added to our
          "<link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/events/">events</link>"
          SVN repository.
        </li>
        <li>
          See notes about the <link href="site:plan/overview">topic of the day</link>.
        </li>
        <li>
          We hope to also have a Lenya instance. This will enable a "whiteboard"
          for the day, and also be the first step for later Forrest-Lenya integration.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <title>Notes for channel operator</title>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first person to join the channel is the operator.
        </li>
        <li>
          See the irchelp.org
          <link href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/changuide.html">guide</link>
          for channel operators.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure that your irc client is creating a logfile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decide on a channel name. Join it a bit before the start time, then do
          this setup ...
        </li>
        <li>
          Set the channel mode: <code>/mode +n</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Declare today's topic: <code>/topic ForrestFriday: XHTML2 core and Jira cleanup</code>
        </li>
        <li>Ask cheche to start the logger bot and tell the URL for the live logfile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure that your client is creating a logfile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Begin a summary text file in the "forrest-events" SVN. Committers
          should add to this during the day. Don't leave it until the end.
        </li>
        <li>
          Announce to the dev mailing list that the channel is open and tell the channel name
          and the URL for the live log.
        </li>
        <li>
          During the session, occasionally refer to the live logfile URL. People can read
          what they missed, and also refer to previous discussion by stating the time that
          it occurred.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end, everyone leaves the channel and it will automatically close.
          Ask cheche to stop the logger bot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the logfile to the Forrest Events repository.
        </li>
      </ul>
