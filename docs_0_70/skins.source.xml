      <p>
        Forrest supplies a collection of default skins which are configurable
        and so should meet the needs of most projects. The aim is to provide
        many capabilities so that extra skins are not needed.

      <title>Convention for choosing skin names</title>
      <p>
        The skin names are based on playing with the word "skin". See our
        technique for
        <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/main/webapp/skins/new-skin-names.txt">choosing skin names</link>.
        A name with "-dev" extension signifies that it is under development.
        There is no concept of versions of default skins.
        New skins have new names.

      <section id="pelt">
        <title>pelt</title>
        <p>
          Uses CSS "div" and no HTML tables.
        </p>
        <p>Examples:
          <link href="site:forrest">Apache Forrest</link> |
          <link href="ext:lenya">Apache Lenya</link>

      <section id="view">
        <title>view/viewHelper</title>
        <p>
          This is the evolution of the "leather-dev" skin, to have contracts. 
          It allows the user to provide their own implementations of contracts.
          The view is controlled by a config file that is easy to understand.
          It is still in development. Note: you need to have both plugins installed.
        </p>

        <p>Examples:

      <section id="tigris">
        <title>tigris</title>
        <p>
          This skin is based on version 1.1 of the 
          <link href="http://style.tigris.org/">style.tigris.org</link> project.
          (It deliberately contravenes our skin naming convention.)
        </p>
        <p>Examples:
          <link href="http://www.core.gen.tr/">Core Computer Security Group</link>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="plain-dev">
        <title>plain-dev</title>
        <p>
          This is a very minimal skin to produce plain HTML documents.
          Such capability might be useful to generate a collection of
          documents for some off-line product's user help system.
        </p>

        <p>Examples:
          <link href="images/snapshot-plain-dev.png">snapshot</link>

      <title>Old and deprecated skins</title>
      <p>
        The following skins are retained for a little while longer, but are
        deprecated, so please move to one of the other skins.
      </p>

      <section id="forrest-site">
        <title>forrest-site</title>
        <p>
          This is the old skin that we have been dragging around since early
          days. Uses HTML tables.
        </p>
        <p>Examples:
          <link href="ext:xml.apache.org">Apache XML</link>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="krysalis-site">
        <title>krysalis-site</title>
        <p>
          Uses HTML tables.
