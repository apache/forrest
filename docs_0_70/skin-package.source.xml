Skins are standard zip archives with a *.zip extension.
This enables them to be unpacked and installed automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
To publish a skin:
      </p>

<source xml:space="preserve">
1 - forrest package-skin
The skin package will be made in the skin dir, next to the custom skin.
2 - place the file in a directory on a web server
3 - ask forrest-dev to add the url and the skin name to the list of skins
</source>


      <p>
To use a custom skin with automatic download:
      </p>

<source xml:space="preserve">
1 - set the skin property in forrest.properties to the name of the skin
2 - forrest install-skin
3 - forrest
</source>

      <p>
Currently there are two test skins: "testskin" and "testskin2"
      </p>

      <p>
To see the names of the remote skins:
      </p>

<source xml:space="preserve">forrest available-skins</source>

      <p>
The skin will get blown away by the next 'build clean' in forrest.
But that is okay because it is so quick to go get another copy. Also it
may be preferable to get a fresh copy. If the user wanted to keep
the skin and perhaps enhance it, then they can copy it to their project.
