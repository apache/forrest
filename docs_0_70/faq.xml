      </section><section id="overview"><title>1.2.  Where can I read an overview about how to work with Forrest? </title>
        <p>
          See the <link href="site:v0.70//your-project">Using Forrest</link>
          guide.
        </p>
      </section><section id="requirements"><title>1.3.  What are the system requirements for Forrest? </title>
        <p>
          Forrest includes everything necessary to build and run, except of
          course for Java. In addition to all the Cocoon JARs, Forrest includes
          and uses its own version of Apache Ant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java 1.4 (or newer) is required. If you are only going to use Forrest
          as-is then you need only the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If you
          intend to enhance and rebuild Forrest (or use the Forrest sources with
          Subversion or use a source snapshot) then you need the full JDK.
        </p>
      </section><section id="cvs"><title>1.4.  The old xml-forrest CVS code repository seems to be stale. What happened? </title>
        <p>
          Forrest switched from a CVS code repository to SVN (Subversion) code
          repository. The old CVS repository is closed and not kept current.
        </p>
      </section><section id="svn"><title>1.5.  How can I use SVN to keep up to date with the latest codebase? </title>
        <p>

      </section><section id="older-plugins"><title>1.6.  How to use older versions of specific plugins? </title>
        <p>
          Sometimes one does not want to use the most recent functionality of a
          plugin and instead need to use an older version. Information about
          changes to each plugin can be found in its
          <link href="site:v0.70//plugins/index">documentation</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the forrest.properties file, specify the version of the plugin that
          you require, e.g.
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.PhotoGallery-0.1,...</source>
        <p>
          Users of Forrest-0.7 will need to do this for the projectInfo plugin
          if you get the following error ...
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">Could not find component for role:
 [org.apache.cocoon.components.modules.input.InputModule/lm]
 (Key='org.apache.cocoon.components.modules.input.InputModule/</source>
        <p>
          ... then sorry, we mistakenly added new "locationmap" functionality
          (due in version 0.8). So do this ...
        </p>

          *** can't create title mutex, Win32 error 6</code>. </title>
        <p>
          This
          <link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?key=FOR-10">appears
          to be a bug in cygwin</link>. Please use the .bat script instead.
        </p>
      </section><section id="maxmemory"><title>1.9.  How can I specify the amount of memory to be used by Java? </title>
        <p>
          There are two ways to control this. If you get an OutOfMemoryError
          when Cocoon is generating pages, see the first paragraph. If you get
          an OutOfMemoryError when outside of Cocoon (e.g., copying raw files),
          see the second paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>maxmemory</code> property in the
          <code>forrest.properties</code> file controls how much memory Cocoon
          uses. Like many other properties you can copy them from the default
          configuration at <code>src/core/fresh-site/forrest.properties</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Set the <code>ANT_OPTS</code> environment variable before you run
          forrest. The exact value you set it to is dependant on your JVM, but
          something like <code>ANT_OPTS=-Xmx500M</code> will probably work.
        </p>
      </section></section><section id="content_faqs"><title>2. Content Creation</title><section id="edit-content"><title>2.1. What tools can be used to edit the content?</title>
        <p>
          If you are using the Apache Forrest xml
          <link href="site:v0.70//dtd-docs">document format</link> or DocBook or
          other xml document types, then you can use any text editor or even a
          dedicated xml editor. You must ensure valid xml. See our
          <link href="site:v0.70//catalog">configuration
          notes</link> for various editors.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are content management systems like
          <link href="ext:lenya">Apache Lenya</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that Forrest can also use other source formats, such as
          OpenOffice.org docs or JSPWiki. Use the appropriate editor for those
          document types and ensure that the document stucture is consistent.
          Forrest can also use "html" as the source format, in which case you
          can use text editors or "html editors" such as the one provided with
          the Mozilla web browser.
        </p>
      </section><section id="site-xml"><title>2.2. 
        How to use the <code>site.xml</code> configuration file for menus and linking.
      </title>
        <p>
          The <code>site.xml</code> configuration file is used for two different
          purposes: defining the left-hand navigation menus, and as a method for
          defining references to be used when linking between documents. This
          file is fully explained in <link href="site:v0.70//linking">Menus and
          Linking</link>. Here is a precis:
        </p>
        <p>
          The labels can be whatever text you want.
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;faq label="FAQs" href="faq.html"&gt;
  &lt;tech label="Technical" href="faq-tech.html"&gt;
    &lt;docbook href="#docbook"/&gt;
    &lt;ignoring_javadocs href="#ignoring_javadocs"/&gt;
  &lt;/tech&gt;
  &lt;user label="User" href="faq-user.html"&gt;
&lt;/faq&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          That will create a menu like this with three links:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">FAQs
   Technical
   User</source>
        <p>
          These documents can be linked to from other documents, like this:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;a href="site:v0.70//faq/tech"&gt; link to the top of the Tech FAQs
&lt;a href="site:v0.70//faq/tech/docbook"&gt; link to the DocBook FAQ in the Tech FAQs
        </source>
        <p>
          If that "docbook" entry was a unique name in your site.xml then you
          can shorten that latter link:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;a href="site:v0.70//docbook"&gt; link to the DocBook FAQ in the Tech FAQs
        </source>
      </section><section id="examples"><title>2.3. 
        Where are examples of documents and site.xml and tabs.xml files?
      </title>
        <p>
          There are examples in the 'forrest seed site' and also the Forrest
          website documents are included with the distribution (cd
          forrest/site-author; forrest run).
        </p>
      </section><section id="PDF-output"><title>2.4. How can I generate one pdf-file out of the whole site or selected pages of the site?</title>
        <p>
          Add the following entries to your site.xml file:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;about tab="home" label="About" href=""&gt;
 	  ...
    &lt;all_site label="Full HTML" href="wholesite.html"/&gt;    
    &lt;all_sitePDF label="Full PDF" href="wholesite.pdf"/&gt;  
     ...
  &lt;/about&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          In this case the menu labeled "About" will have 2 new items: "Full
          PDF" and "Full HTML". (See also
          <link href="site:v0.70//howto/pdf-tab">How to create a PDF document
          for each tab</link>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This assumes that you use the
          <link href="site:v0.70//linking">site.xml</link> method for your site
          structure and navigation, rather than the old book.xml method.
        </p>
      </section><section id="pageBreaks"><title>2.5. How do I insert page breaks into documents?</title>
        <p>
          Page breaks do not make a great deal of sense in HTML documents
          intended for display on a screen. However, PDF documents are intended
          for printing and therefore page breaks can be important.
        </p>
        <p>
          To insert a page break in a PDF document simply add
          <em>pageBreakBefore</em> and/or <em>pageBreakAfter</em> to the class
          attribute of the block you wish to force a page break on. All the
          common block grouping elements support this class, for example, note,
          warning, p and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want these classes to be processed in your HTML documents as
          well you should add the following to the <code>extra-css</code>
          element in your projects <code>skinconf.xml</code>
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve"> .pageBreakBefore { margin-bottom: 0; page-break-before: always; } .pageBreakAfter {
          margin-bottom: 0; page-break-after: always; } </source>
      </section><section id="clickable-email-address"><title>2.6. How can I generate html-pages to show a 'clickable' email-address (of the
        author-element)?</title>
        <p>
          You would override <code>
          $FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/skins/common/xslt/html/document2html.xsl</code>
          and edit the "headers/authors" template.
        </p>
      </section><section id="link_raw"><title>2.7. How do I link to raw files such as config.txt and brochure.pdf? </title>
        <p>
          Handling of raw files was significantly changed in Forrest 0.7. See
          <link href="site:v0.70//upgrading_07/raw">Upgrading to Apache Forrest
          0.7</link> for all the details.
        </p>
      </section><section id="pdf_images"><title>2.8. Images don't display in PDFs. How do I fix this?</title>
        <p>
          Forrest uses <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</link>
          for rendering PDFs. FOP cannot handle all image types natively, and
          requires third-party jars to be added. FOP natively handles BMP, GIF,
          JPG, TIFF and EPS (with a few limitations). FOP can also handle SVG
          (via Batik!and PNG (see below). For details, see
          <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/graphics.html">FOP
          Graphics formats</link>
        </p>
        <p>
          To get PNGs working in PDFs with Jimi:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download Jimi from <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/">http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/</link></li>
          <li>Unpack the Jimi distribution and copy JimiProClasses.zip to
              <code>$FORREST/lib/optional/jimi-1.0.jar</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Alternatively you can use JAI (Java Advanced Imaging API at
          http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai). For more info, see
          <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/graphics.html#packages">FOP
          Graphics Packages</link>
        </p>
        <note>
          Due to Sun's licensing, we cannot redistribute Jimi or JAI with
          Forrest.

      </section><section id="tab-index"><title>2.9.  The tab link in my site incorrectly assumes that 'index.html' is present in the
        linked-to directory. How do I fix this? </title>
        <p>
          In <code>tabs.xml</code>, use @href instead of @dir, and omit the
          trailing '/'. Which file to serve is then a concern of the sitemap.
          For example, if the "User Manual" tab should link to
          <code>manual/Introduction.html</code> then <code>tabs.xml</code>
          should contain:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;tab label="User Manual" href="manual"/&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          and add this rule to the sitemap:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;map:match pattern="manual"&gt;
    &lt;map:redirect-to uri="manual/Introduction.html"/&gt;
  &lt;/map:match&gt;
        </source>
      </section><section id="tab-site"><title>2.10. I need help with the interaction between tabs.xml and site.xml </title>

          See the <link href="site:v0.70//linking/tab-site">tips</link>.
        </p>
      </section><section id="defaultFileName"><title>2.11.  How can I change the default file name that Forrest will look for when I request a
        URL like <code>http://myserver</code> or <code>http://myserver/mydir/</code> ? </title>
        <p>
          To change the default file name from 'index.html' (default) to
          'overview.html' you need to make the following changes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Create a '<link href="#cli-xconf">cli.xconf</link>' file for your project </li>
          <li> Edit that file to replace 'index.html' in
            &lt;default-filename&gt;index.html&lt;/default-filename&gt;
            with 'overview.html'. </li>
          <li> Edit your project's <link href="site:v0.70//project-sitemap">sitemap.xmap</link> file. </li>
          <li> Add the following code just before the end of the pipelines-element:<source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;map:pipeline&gt;
    &lt;map:match type="regexp" pattern="^.+/$"&gt;
       &lt;map:redirect-to uri="overview.html"/&gt;
    &lt;/map:match&gt;
  &lt;/map:pipeline&gt;
          
            </source></li>
        </ol>
      </section><section id="defaultStartPage"><title>2.12.  How can I use a start-up-page other than index.html? </title>
        <p>
          Forrest by default assumes that the first page (home page) of your
          site is named index.html. Which is good because most web servers are
          configured to look for index.html when you call a url like
          http://myserver
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most settings in Forrest however this can be changed, for example
          when you want your start-up-page for a CD-based documentation project
          to be named 'start.html'.
        </p>
        <p>
          To change the start page of a site:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Edit your project's <link href="site:v0.70//project-sitemap">sitemap.xmap</link> file.</li>
          <li>Add the following code just before the end of the pipelines-element:<source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;map:pipeline&gt;
    &lt;map:match pattern=""&gt;
      &lt;map:redirect-to uri="start.html" /&gt;
    &lt;/map:match&gt;
  &lt;/map:pipeline&gt;
          
            </source></li>
          <li>Name the uri-attribute whatever you'd like your start page to be.</li>
          <li>Don't forget to create that page and refer to it in your site.xml</li>
        </ol>
      </section><section id="label-entity"><title>2.13.  How to use special characters in the labels of the site.xml file? </title>
        <p>
          Use the numeric values for character entities. For example, rather
          than using <code>
&amp;ouml;
          </code> use <code>
&amp;#246;
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          See the
          <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/dtd_module_defs.html#a_xhtml_character_entities">XHTML
          Character Entities</link> and see more discussion at
          <link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-244">Issue
          FOR-244</link>.
        </p>
      </section><section id="encoding"><title>2.14. Does Forrest handle accents for non-English languages?</title>
        <p>
          Yes, Forrest can process text in any language, so you can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>accents: á é í ó ú</li>
          <li>diereses: ä ë ï ö ü</li>
          <li>tildes: ã ñ &#297; õ &#361;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is because sources for Forrest docs are xml documents, which can
          include any of these, provided the encoding declared by the xml doc
          matches the actual encoding used in the file. For example if you
          declare the default encoding:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          but the file content is actually using ISO-8859-1 then you will
          receive validation errors, especially if you include some non-ASCII
          characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          This situation is commonly encountered when you edit the templates
          created by <code>forrest seed</code> with your favorite (probably
          localized) editor without paying attention to the encoding, or when
          you create a new file and simply copy the headers from another file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although UTF-8 is an encoding well-suited for most languages, it is
          not usually the default in popular editors or systems. In UNIX-like
          systems, most popular editors can handle different encodings to write
          the file in disk. With some editors the encoding of the file is
          preserved, while with others the default is used regardless of the
          original encoding. In most cases the encoding used to write files can
          be controlled by setting the environment variable <code>LANG</code> to
          an appropriate value, for instance:
        </p>

          Of course the <em>appropriate</em> way to set the encoding depends on
          the editor/OS, but ultimately relys on the user preferences. So you
          can use the encoding you prefer, as long as the <code>encoding</code>
          attribute of the xml declaration matches the actual encoding of the
          file. This means that if you are not willing to abandon ISO-8859-1 you
          can always use the following declaration instead:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          Another option is to use "character entities" such as <code>
&amp;ouml;
          </code> (ö) or the numeric form <code>
&amp;#246;
          </code> (ö).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another related issue is that your webserver needs to send http
          headers with the matching charset definitions to the html page.

        <p>
          By default Forrest does not clean its build directories in the project
          workspaces. This enables Cocoon to use its disk cache to speed up
          successive runs of forrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing 'forrest clean-site' will remove the contents of the project's
          generated documents directory. Doing 'forrest clean-work' will remove
          the project's work directories (usually build/tmp and build/webapp
          which include the Cocoon cache and the Cocoon logs). Doing 'forrest
          clean' will remove both sections.

        <p>
          Forrest uses a configuration file to control the processing done by
          the Apache Cocoon command-line called cli.xconf
        </p>
        <p>
          Your project can supply its own <code>cli.xconf</code> and define
          patterns for URIs to exclude. There are also other powerful
          configuration features.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means creating a directory <code>src/documentation/conf</code>
          (or wherever <code>${forrest.conf-dir}</code> points) and copying
          <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cli.xconf</code> to it.
          Declare the location of this file in the forrest.properties
          configuration, e.g.
          <code>project.configfile=${project.home}/src/documentation/conf/cli.xconf</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then edit cli.xconf, and add any exclude sections that you require.
          The default cli.xconf ignores directory links and links containing
          'apidocs' or starting with 'api/':
        </p>

          First consider whether your needs would be better met by Cocoon
          itself, rather than Forrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, there are valid reasons for wanting programmatically
          generated content, so here is how to enable XSP:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download <link href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/cocoon-2.1/lib/optional/jdtcore-2.1.0.jar?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=application/java">jdtcore-2.1.0.jar</link>, and copy it to the $FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib
            directory (or lib/core/ directory in the source distribution).</li>
          <li><p>
              Add the following generator definition in the map:generators
              section of your
              <link href="site:v0.70//project-sitemap">project

            </source></li>
          <li><p>
              Decide how you want to use XSP. For single files, you could just
              define a *.xml matcher:

&lt;/map:match&gt;
            </source>
            <p>
              You may instead wish to override forrest.xmap to define a general

        <p>
          Breadcrumbs begin with up to three URLs specified in
          <code>skinconf.xml</code>. Here is what the Forrest site uses:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;trail&gt;
    &lt;link1 name="apache" href="http://www.apache.org/"/&gt;

  &lt;/trail&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          If any links are blank, they are not used. After these first links,
          JavaScript looks at the URL for the current page and makes a link for
          each directory after the domain. If you are viewing the site locally,
          there is no domain and so there will be no extra breadcrumbs, only the

        <p>
          One <code>site.xml</code> file in your project root can replace all the book.xml files
          (one per directory) in your site. Internally, Forrest uses <code>site.xml</code> to
          dynamically generate book.xml files. However, Forrest first checks for
          the existence of a book.xml file, so backwards-compatibility is
          preserved. If a directory has a book.xml file, the book.xml will be
          used to generate the menu. This supplement is useful in situations
          where <code>site.xml</code>-generated menus aren't appropriate. See
          <link href="site:v0.70//linking">Menus and Linking</link>.
        </p>
      </section><section id="docbook"><title>5.2.  How do I use DocBook as the xml documentation format? </title>
        <p>
          There are two ways. Forrest has a <code>simplifiedDocbook</code>
          plugin which can transform the DocBook format into the Forrest "xdocs"
          format on-the-fly and then render that as normal Forrest documents. Be
          aware that the stylesheet that does this transformation is
          deliberately very limited and does not attempt to deal with all
          DocBook elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other way is to use the full DocBook stylesheets directly. The
          DocBook DTDs are shipped with Forrest and automatically handled.
          However, you will need to have the DocBook stylesheets on your system
          (they are too massive to ship with Forrest) and configure Forrest
          accordingly. You will need to create a
          <link href="site:v0.70//project-sitemap">project sitemap</link> as
          explained in <link href="site:v0.70//your-project">Using
          Forrest</link> and add matches to handle your DocBook documents. Here
          is an example. Note that you need to change it to suit your situation.
          The match must be very specific so that only the DocBook documents are
          matched. The rest of the documents will be handled by Forrest core.
          Powerful regex capabilities are available.

          type="xhtml"/&gt; in the components section of the sitemap. See the
          <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/serializers/xhtml-serializer.html">Cocoon
          docs</link> for the elements you need to add to define this component.
          You can see examples of other components being added in the
          <code>FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/sitemap.xmap</code> file.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use a mixture of the two methods, some handled
          automatically by Forrest and some directly using DocBook stylesheets.
          You can also have a mixture of source files as "document-v*" DTD and
          DocBook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ensure that the document type declaration in your xml instance is well
          specified. Use a public identifier. The DTD will then be properly
          resolved by Forrest. If you need to use different DTDs, then see
          <link href="site:v0.70//your-project/new_dtd">Using Forrest</link> for
          configuration guidance.

      </section><section id="version"><title>5.3.  How to report which version of Forrest is being used and the properties that are
        set? </title>
        <p>
          Do <code>'forrest -projecthelp'</code> or <code>'./build.sh'</code> to
          find the version number.
        </p>
        <p>
          To list the properties, add "forrest.echo=true" to your
          forrest.properties file and watch the build messages. Doing
          <code>'forrest -v'</code> will provide verbose build messages.
        </p>
      </section><section id="logs"><title>5.4.  Where are the log files to find more infomation about errors? </title>
        <p>
          The logfiles are at <code>build/webapp/WEB-INF/logs/</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          The log level can be raised with the <code>logkit.xconf</code>
          configuration. If you are using Forrest in the interactive webapp mode
          (which is generally easiest for debugging errors) then see the
          <code>build/webapp/WEB-INF/logkit.xconf</code> file. If you are
          generating a static site (with command-line 'forrest') then copy
          <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/logkit.xconf</code> to your
          project at <code>src/documentation/content/conf/logkit.xconf</code>
          and modify it. See more information and efficiency tips with
          <link href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/ExploringTheLogs">Cocoon
          logging</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing <code>'forrest -v'</code> will provide verbose build messages to
          the standard output.
