      <p>
        Like stated in the <link href="site:v0.70//documentation/skins">Skin documentation 
        file</link> the aim of the forrest skins is to provide
        many capabilities so that extra skins are not needed. Our experience showed that many forrest user 
        had to create a new skin because the default skin did not offer the feature their wanted to use. 
        That leaded us to develop a new concept of creating skins that would be easily extensible by a user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of the upcoming "forrest:views" skinning concept is to provide a flexible framework for creating
        site and page specific layout in different formats.

        The problem with the forrest skins so far has been that "only" the design changed (html-skeleton),
        but still we had to write a completely new skin and implement all functionality.
        Another problem was that the functionality was not easy extensible by a user.
        Then we decided to support the a standard regarding naming conventions for css elements.
        This standard has been developed on the <link href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/skins">
        OSCOM website</link>, where you can find some more background informations.

      <title>Definition of naming conventions</title>
      <p>
        "A naming convention is an attempt to systematize names in a field so 
        they unambiguously convey similar information in a similar manner."

      <p>
        That leaded to the development of the "leather-dev" skin which established a semantic container approach for div elements. 
        The problems with leather-dev was pointed out on the mail 
          <link href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=forrest-dev m=111049344517653 w=2">status on leather-dev?</link>
