    <title>Our Contract</title> 
    <notice>The legal tone of this document is just a gimmick, this is not a
      legal document in any sense. At all times: since this is open source: the real
      contract is described in the implementation details of the full distribution.
      This tries to list (not explain) what the ins and outs of using Forrest is
      about. Please let the forrest-dev
      <link href="site:mail-lists">mail list</link> know if
      any of the bullets listed here are out of sync with the real
      implementation.</notice>
    <abstract>This document describes, in a very techy bullet-style way, how
      to use Forrest.</abstract> 
  </header> 
  <body> 
    <note>
      This document describes the formal contract between the
      <strong>Forrest distribution code</strong>, hereafter referred as 
      "Forrest", and
      the <strong>Project (team)</strong> that is using it for generating
      its documentation and  web-site, hereafter referred to as "TheProject".
    </note>
    <note>
      Some terminology will assist: <code>{docroot}</code> is the location
      inside TheProject's file hierarchy where all documentation related
      resources are stored. Usually <code>{docroot}</code> equals to
      <code>{projecthome}/src/documentation</code>
