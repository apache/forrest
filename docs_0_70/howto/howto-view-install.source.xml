  <title>How to install the view package</title>
  <abstract>
    This How-To describes the setup of the plugins (needed to work with forrest:views and forrest:contracts) and a fresh seed.

<warning>
"Views" are new functionality which is still in development phase. That is why it is in the
"whiteboard" section of the Forrest distribution.
This HowTo is a good start but still needs proof-reading.
</warning>

    <p>
      Users/devs who wants to get started with view development.
      This setup guide is valid for both user and devs.
    </p>
  </section><section id="Purpose"><title>Purpose</title>
    <p>
      To help user installing views. This is the "getting started" setup-guide.
    </p>
  </section><section id="Prerequisites"><title>Prerequisites</title>
    <ul>
      <li>You have to use the trunk version of forrest for using views because it is in an early stage</li>
    </ul>
  </section><section id="Steps"><title>Steps</title>
    <p>
      The process of setting up the plugin is quite heavy. We promise it will be easier in the future. 
      Some of the instructions has to be modified with your local settings.
    </p>
    <section id="localBuild">
      <title>Build the view and the viewHelper plugins</title>
      <p>
        The first step is to build the view and the viewHelper plugins. Change to a console of your choice
        and go (cd) to the trunk version of forrest {forrest-trunk}. Then do an update and after this 
        deploy both plugins locally.
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve">
cd {forrest-trunk}
svn up
cd whiteboard/plugins/org.apache.forrest.plugin.internal.view/
ant local-deploy
cd ../org.apache.forrest.plugin.output.viewHelper.xhtml/
ant local-deploy
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="newSeed">
      <title>Seed a new project</title>
      <p> 
				Go to the dir where you want to seed a new project and seed it. 
        Then we have to prepare a default.fv directory in project.conf-dir (forrest.properties) 
        of the fresh seed. That will be needed as soon you modify the default view of your project.
        The "templates"-directory is need for your project specific contract implementations.
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve">
cd ~/src/newSeed
forrest seed
mkdir src/documentation/conf
mkdir src/documentation/resources/templates
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="forrestProperties">
      <title>Modifying forrest.properties</title>
      <p>
        Now we have to tell forrest that we are planing to use the view plugins. We will do that
        by editing to the forrest.properties to add the plugins:
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve">
project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.output.viewHelper.xhtml,org.apache.forrest.plugin.internal.view
      </source>
      <p>
	     Now we have to change the project skin to leather-dev. The reason is that the plugins are still
       not independend form the "old fashion skins".  
      </p>
      <note>We exchanging only
	     site2xhtml.xsl of leather-dev skin by the plugins and some contracts are based
	     on e.g. document2html.xsl output of leather-dev.</note>
     <source xml:space="preserve">
project.skin=leather-dev
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="testing">
      <title>Test your new view based project</title>
      <p> 
        Now you have finished the preparation and the setup to finally try
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve">
forrest run
      </source>
      <p>then point to <a href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a> and you should see the default
        view based skin.</p>
      <note>When developing styles with views 'forrest run' is the quickest
way. You will see you do not have to build your project to see the
changes on your pages when working with *.fv. </note>
    </section>
    <section id="availableContracts">
	    <title>Available contracts</title>
	    <p> 
	     To start working with views you need to know which contracts you can use. 
	     For this we will install another plugin <code>org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.viewHelper.xhtml.ls</code>.
	     The setup is:
	    </p>
	    <source xml:space="preserve">
cd {forrest-trunk}
svn up
cd whiteboard/plugins/org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.viewHelper.xhtml.ls/
ant local-deploy
</source>
			<p>
        The newly installed plugin will show the available contracts as html page.
        First we have to tell forrest that we are planing to use the new plugin. We will do that
        by editing the forrest.properties of the <a href="site:howto/view/install">newSeed</a> 
        to <strong>add</strong> the plugin:
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve">
project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.viewHelper.xhtml.ls
      </source>
      <p>
        Now point your browser to <code>http://localhost:8888/ls.contracts.html</code>. 
        On this page you will find all contracts that you can use in your project.
      </p>
