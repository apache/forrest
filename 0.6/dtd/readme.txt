There is a .htaccess in this directory.
Its purpose is to deliver DTDs and associated resources to some
impoverished XML tools that do not use the Catalog Entity Resolver.

FIXME: There are similar .htaccess at both
forrest.apache.org/dtd/ and forrest.apache.org/entity/
until we merge the entity sets into the /dtd/ directory.
