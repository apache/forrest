<div class="section">
<div class="warning">
<div class="label">Warning</div>
<div class="content">
        This document is constantly being developed and some steps will need to be
        re-arranged. There are some fixme notes that we will review after each
        release. Do not take this document at face value - always try to visualise the
        effect of each step.
      </div>
</div>
<p>
        This documents the steps that the Release Manager (RM) should follow
        when doing a Forrest release. Note that it might have mistakes - we seem
        to discover something new each time and some steps might need to happen
        in a different order. Fine tune these notes for next time. Do some
        practice runs. Read through these notes often in the lead up to the
        release to imagine the effect and order of some steps.
      </p>
<p>
        There are some steps that other committers, and even developers, can
        assist with, especially in the areas of getting ready for the release
        and the final testing. Many of the steps can be done only by the Release
        Manager.
      </p>
<p>
        The lead-up to the release is a good opportunity to build the project community
        and to draw in new developers. The steps in this process try to maximise that.
      </p>
<div class="fixme">
<div class="label">Fixme (open)</div>
<div class="content">
        Some of the complexity in this process is due to site-author docs accompanying
        the release. That is a good thing because then they have local docs.
        However it complicates this process because the documentation version numbers,
        xdocs layout, site.xml navigation, etc. all need to be relevant for
        packing with the release. Trunk needs to stay that way during testing of RCs.
        Just before the release announcement, certain things need to be updated to
        create and publish the website. Then following the release, updated to be
        ready for the next develoment cycle. Much of that process in unavoidable, but
        some could be simplified.

<h2 class="underlined_10">Who is the Release Manager</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
        The Release Manager is a single person who does the final work of the
        release process to prepare and sign release packages, co-ordinate
        testing and voting, uploading to the dist area and ensuring mirrors, and
        sending the announcement.
      </p>
<p>
        The project developers have the role of preparing the product to release
        quality, testing, fixing issues, and voting for the release candidate.
        The votes of the PMC will <a href="#vote">decide</a> whether the product is fit for release.
      </p>
<p>
        The RM makes all the <a href="#decisionRM">decisions</a> regarding the actual preparations and the
        doing of the release. Many projects have the same release manager for
        years.
      </p>
<p>
        The RM could do the job alone, which enables speedy process. There are
        not actually many tasks where assistants can help. However it is a good
        idea to have an assistant so as to pass on the knowledge, to help
        document the process, and to perceive potential flaws. More than one
        assistant would probably hinder.
      </p>
<p>
        The RM needs to have an incredible amount of time and energy available,
        especially to prepare the first release candidate and to finalise the release.
      </p>
<p>
        The RM should be comfortable with using SVN and be familiar with the ASF
        hardware, with the distribution mirror system, and with ASF release
        procedures. Also need to be a quick decision-maker and able to find and solve
        issues on the spot. It would be nice if others help to solve last minute
        issues, but don't expect it.
      </p>
<p>
        The following notes are terse. If you don't understand, then
        probably not ready to be RM.
      </p>
</div>

<h2 class="underlined_10">Tasks to be done by the project before the release can start</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
        There are a number of things to be done by the project before the
        release will start. Don't leave these until the last minute. It is not
        the Release Manager's job to fix bugs nor address blocker issues. The RM
        job begins after the project is ready to do the release.
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>The project updates the Roadmap to schedule the realistic Issues.</li>
        
<li>The project made good progress towards fixing the Blockers and applying the outstanding patches.</li>
        
<li>The documentation content is ready.</li>
        
<li>Plugins have been reviewed and deployed as necessary. Some perhaps need to
          go through a release process. This should happen independently of the release process.
        </li>
        
<li>Supporting products (e.g. Ant, Xerces) should have been updated well before this
                stage. Do not attempt such upgrades too close to the release, as it
                will distract attention from other issues and possibly introduce new problems.
              </li>
        
<li>Add some issues to the Roadmap for the important general issues that need to
                happen before the release.
                Some examples from last time: FOR-911, FOR-868, FOR-865, FOR-855, FOR-644.
              </li>
        
<li>
<p>
            Relevant changes are listed in the site-author/status.xml and
            contributers have been attributed. Other changes are listed in the
            various plugins/status.xml files.
          </p>
</li>
        
<li>Add relevant information to the
                <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-868">upgrading notes</a>.
              </li>
        
<li>
<p>
            Major changes are listed in the site-author/status.xml using the
            "importance" attribute. This will be used to generate the list of
            top changes for the Release Notes and Announcement text.

                Committers (as many as possible) have their up-to-date PGP keys

        Decide the content of the release. Previously we just packed everything
        in trunk (see the "release-dist" target) and included a built

            If so, then send an email to get the project to decide what to do

<p>
        Particularly the Release Manager, but also anyone assisting, needs to be
        familiar with standard procedures and Apache terminology. This is
        crucial for a successful release.
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>
<p>
            If you have never done a release before or need to refresh your
            memory, read all about Apache releases in general at
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/#releases">http://www.apache.org/dev/#releases</a>
            (note that these documents change often). Make sure any assistants
            have read and understood this as well.
          </p>
</li>
        
<li>As discussed above, be sure that you have plenty of time and energy.
          You will need to be persistent throughout the process.
        </li>
        
<li>
<p>
            Be familiar with the process of signing release packages and generating MD5
            and PGP. Some more info is at

        There are various reasons for voting on the Release Plan, e.g. makes
        people aware that a code-freeze is about to happen; encourage them to
        get involved with the release; ensure that the date is suitable and
        people will be around to test and then vote on the actual release. This
        ensures that it is the PMC as a whole that prepares and issues the
        release, rather than an individual. Such procedures give us the
        protection accorded by the ASF being a corporation. See a good

        We need to discuss order from here on. My idea is to adjust docs before
        we enter code freeze to save time later. But if the rc fails and release
        is postponed might need to roll back changes easily and - if possible -
        roll them forward later. So creating an svn branch for the rc seems to
        make sense to me. Probably easiest would be to create an rc branch here
        and co that. wdyt?
      </div>
</div>
<p>
        In this step you make absolutely sure that your working copy of SVN
        trunk has no local modifications, or additional files that you have been
        fiddling with, and especially files that might be hidden by svn:ignore
        settings.
      </p>
<p>
        There are two ways to do this. Either do a complete new svn checkout, or
        use the 'svn status --no-ignore' command on your existing working copy.
      </p>
<ol>
        
<li>
<p>
            In a new empty directory do <span class="codefrag">'svn co

</p>
</li>
      
</ol>
<p>
        Alternative Approach
      </p>
<ol>
        
<li> Do 'svn update -r HEAD' to ensure that you are up-to-date. </li>
        
<li> Run 'svn status --no-ignore' </li>
        
<li>
<p>
            Delete any extra files you might have added/changed in your local
            copy. Delete any "build" directories in plugins, etc. <strong>Extra
            files must not be packed with the release.</strong> It must be a
            pristine copy of the current trunk.

          </p>
          
<p>
            When you see that a good proportion of the mirrors have received the
            release, then update the website, then send the announcement.
          </p>
</li>
        
<li>Ensure that docs are *not* being excluded via site-author/conf/cli.xconf
           as we need to re-build the whole site.</li>
        
<li>Before re-building and deploying the new website, check the time.
          Remember that an 'svn up' happens our on server just after the hour, then
          a bit later the rsync happens and the site is live about 20 minutes past.
          This site deployment will take some time, mostly because you are actually
          doing a fresh installation of a local forrestbot (it does 'svn co forrest/site').
        </li>
        
<li>
<p>
            Re-build and publish the Forrest website as normal. Be
            sure to use the new version of trunk for building the docs. Refer to
            <a href="../../procedures/How_to_publish_docs.html">Publishing Forrest Documentation</a>
            for details. Beware, there is a forrestbot bug whereby with a brand new
            forrest installation, the first deploy only does the added files. So deploy again. 
          </p>
</li>
        
<li>Test the new Forrest <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/">website</a>
          and the redirects
          <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/docs/">f.a.o/docs/</a> and
          <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/docs/dev/">f.a.o/docs/dev/</a> and the

        </li>
        
<li>
<p>
            Update the xml.apache.org website (Forrest is part of the Apache XML
            federation of projects). Edit
            xml-site/src/documentation/content/xdocs/news.xml and record the
            announcement, and then commit the new HTML to
            xml-site/targets/forrest Note that they use forrest-0.7 to build
            their website. See http://xml.apache.org/guidelines.html#website-top
