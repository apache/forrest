Subject: [Important] Release Candidate did NOT build, what now?

The release candidate/documentation for the new release failed the tests. 
A quick attempt at to solve the problems has failed. 

What shall we do now? 

If anybody can suggest a solution please do, otherwise we will have to abort
this release attempt for now and write up a new release plan.
