Subject: [Important] please test release candidate then vote

We need people to test the release candidate on your projects,
especially on different operating systems. Just send a short
reply to this thread that it works for you. See method below.

Download the release candidate and supporting files:
http://www.apache.org/~[your apache user name]/release-forrest-07/

For Windows get *.zip md5sum ################################
For UNIX get *.tar.gz md5sum ################################
Get the *.asc and *.md5 that match your chosen download.

It was packed from SVN revision ####
Java [JavaVersion] or later is required.

If you want to verify the download, then follow:
http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi#verify

Otherwise just get on with testing.

Testing and vote period concludes [Date]
Anyone can test and vote, not just PMC members.
However only the PMC votes are binding.

So we have approximately 6 days.

Here are some hints:

  * Ensure that the compressed archive will unpack properly.
  * Verfiy the release, especially if you are a committer.
  * Follow the README.txt and index.html
  * Set environment variables.
  * Don't worry too much about minor bugs. We are looking
     for blockers, such as it will not run. Many known issues
     are recorded at our Jira, perhaps you can add more.

* Make a fresh site ...
    cd my-new-dir
    forrest seed
    forrest run ... use the local jetty server.
    forrest ... build the whole site from the command-line.
    forrest war ... use your own full Jetty or Tomcat.

* Try it on the Forrest core docs ...
    cd site-author
    forrest run

* Forrest was already pre-built. Try building it again.
    cd main
    build clean
    build
    build test

* Try it on your own project, especially if you have
    a project sitemap and use some extra plugins.
