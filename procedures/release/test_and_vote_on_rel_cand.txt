Subject: [Important] please test release candidate then vote

We need people to test the release candidate on your projects,
especially on different operating systems. Just send a short
reply to this thread that it works for you. See method below.

Download the release candidate and supporting files:
http://people.apache.org/~[your apache user name]/release-forrest-07/

For Windows get *.zip md5sum ################################
For UNIX get *.tar.gz md5sum ################################
Get the *.asc and *.md5 that match your chosen download.

It was packed from SVN revision ####
Java [JavaVersion] or later is required.

If you want to verify the download, then follow:
http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi#verify

Otherwise just get on with testing.

Testing and vote period concludes [Date]
Anyone can test and vote, not just PMC members.
However only the PMC votes are binding.
When voting, quote the md5sum to ensure that we are all
using the correct release candidate.

So we have approximately 6 days.

Here are some hints:

  * Ensure that the compressed archive will unpack properly.
  * Verfiy the release, especially if you are a committer.
  * Follow the README.txt and index.html
  * Set $FORREST_HOME and $PATH appropriately.
  * Many known issues are already recorded at our Jira.
  * Don't worry too much about minor bugs. We are looking
    for blockers, such as it will not run.
  * Please add minor issues to Jira.

* Make a fresh site ...
    cd my-new-dir
    forrest seed
    forrest run ... use the local jetty server.
    forrest ... build the whole site from the command-line.
    forrest war ... use your own full Jetty or Tomcat.

* Try it on the Forrest core docs ...
    cd site-author
    forrest run
    forrest

* Forrest was already pre-built. Try building it again.
    cd main
    build clean
    build
    build test

* Try it on your own project, especially if you have
    a project sitemap and use some extra plugins.
