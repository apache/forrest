      <p>The ForrestBar is a toolbar extension made for the
        <link href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla</link>
        and <link href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</link>

      <title>Installing the ForrestBar</title>
      <p>ForrestBar is currently compatible with Firefox 0.9 - 1.5 and Mozilla
        1.x browsers.</p>
      <p><link href="forrestbar.xpi">Click here to install ForrestBar 0.7</link></p>
      <p>If the extension does not automatically install for you when clicking
        on the link, download ForrestBar by right clicking on the link and select Save
        As... to save the file to your computer. To install, simply drag the
        downloaded .xpi file into your browser's window and drop it.</p>
      <p>To build ForrestBar locally rather than downloading, go to
        FORREST_HOME/tools/forrestbar and run the following command:
        <code>forrest -f build.xml</code> and the .xpi file will be built for you
        in FORREST_HOME/tools/forrestbar/build. You can then install it by
        dragging and dropping as indicated above.</p>
