      </section><section id="overview"><title>1.2.  Where can I read an overview about how to work with Forrest? </title>
        <p>
          See the <link href="site:your-project">Using Forrest</link> guide.
        </p>
      </section><section id="docs"><title>1.3. Where is all of the documentation?</title>
        <p>
          You have a local copy of the main documentation with your version of
          Forrest. Do 'cd site-author; forrest run' and visit
          http://localhost:8888/ in your browser. The most recent documentation
          is in SVN trunk which creates the forrest.apache.org website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each <link href="site:plugins/index">plugin</link> has its own
          documentation and working examples of its techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example seed site has other documentation and working examples of
          various techniques. Do 'cd my-new-directory; forrest seed-sample;
          forrest run'. Every hour the forrestbot generates a static version of
          this documentation on our <link href="site:zone">testing zone</link>.
        </p>
      </section><section id="requirements"><title>1.4.  What are the system requirements for Forrest? </title>
        <p>
          Forrest includes everything necessary to build and run, except of
          course for Java. In addition to all the Cocoon JARs, Forrest includes
          and uses its own version of Apache Ant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java 1.5 (or newer) is required. If you are only going to use Forrest
          as-is then you need only the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If you
          intend to enhance and rebuild Forrest (or use the Forrest sources with
          Subversion or use a source snapshot) then you need the full JDK.
        </p>
      </section><section id="cvs"><title>1.5.  The old xml-forrest CVS code repository seems to be stale. What happened? </title>
        <p>
          Forrest switched from a CVS code repository to SVN (Subversion) code
          repository. The old CVS repository is closed and not kept current.
        </p>
      </section><section id="svn"><title>1.6.  How can I use SVN to keep up to date with the latest codebase? </title>
        <p>
          Follow these <link href="site:build">Building Forrest</link> notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <link href="site:your-project">Using Forrest</link> guide provides
          further step-by-step assistance in getting started with Forrest for
          your project.
        </p>
      </section><section id="older-plugins"><title>1.7.  How to use older versions of specific plugins? </title>
        <p>
          Sometimes one does not want to use the most recent functionality of a
          plugin and instead need to use an older version. Information about
          changes to each plugin can be found in its
          <link href="site:plugins/index">documentation</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the forrest.properties file, specify the version of the plugin that
          you require, e.g.
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.PhotoGallery-0.1,...</source>
        <p>
          Users of Forrest-0.7 will need to do this for the projectInfo plugin
          if you get the following error ...
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">Could not find component for role:
 [org.apache.cocoon.components.modules.input.InputModule/lm]
 (Key='org.apache.cocoon.components.modules.input.InputModule/</source>
        <p>
          ... then sorry, we mistakenly added new "locationmap" functionality
          (due in version 0.8). So do this ...
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.projectInfo-0.1,...</source>
      </section><section id="single-document"><title>1.8.  What is the best way to generate "standalone documents" using Forrest? </title>
        <p>
          There is a trick that can cut down your turnaround time with building.
          In forrest.properties ...
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
# The URL to start crawling from
#project.start-uri=linkmap.html
        </source>
        <p>
          Uncomment that and set it to the specific page that you want. Forrest
          will build that single document, then of course it will keep crawling
          links from there. It might be confined to a sub-directory, but
          depending on links could end up generating the whole site. The main
          thing is that your page of interest is built first.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is probably easiest to make this change temporarily as a
          command-line parameter, e.g.
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
forrest -Dproject.start-uri=live-sites.html
        </source>
        <p>
          You can terminate forrest with 'kill' or Ctrl-C after it has built
          your pages of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cocoon can be instructed via the <link href="#cli-xconf">Cocoon
          cli.xconf</link> file to not follow links (see its "follow-links"
          parameter). So this will build only the document that was specified.
          Be careful, if you also usually build PDF pages, then they will not be
          built.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cocoon can also be instructed to not process certain URIs if you need
          to temporarily exclude then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another useful technique is to use 'wget' or Apache Ant's Get task to
          retrieve individual files, e.g. Do 'forrest run' and then 'wget
          http://localhost:8888/index.pdf'.

        <source xml:space="preserve">

</source>
        <p>
          The version of Jing needs to be updated. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This is fixed in Forrest-0.9-dev version.
          See <link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-984">FOR-984</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          One workaround is to update your copy of the
          <link href="http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/">Jing</link> jar at
          <code>$FORREST_HOME/lib/core/</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Another workaround is to edit the forrest.properties configuration file
          to expose the "forrest.validate.sitemap" property and set it to "false".
          Might need to do the same for the "forrest.validate.stylesheets" property.

      </section><section id="winjava"><title>1.11. Windows gets confused about which Java version to use.</title>
        <p>
          Cough, yes!. See this
          <link href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/forrest-user/200704.mbox/%3c462CA40F.5020400@rblasch.org%3e">explanation</link>
          on the Forrest mail lists.
        </p>
      </section><section id="maxmemory"><title>1.12.  How can I specify the amount of memory to be used by Java? </title>
        <p>
          There are two ways to control this. If you get an OutOfMemoryError
          when Cocoon is generating pages, see the first paragraph. If you get
          an OutOfMemoryError when outside of Cocoon (e.g., copying raw files),
          see the second paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>maxmemory</code> property in the
          <code>forrest.properties</code> file controls how much memory Cocoon
          uses. Like many other properties you can copy them from the default
          configuration at <code>main/fresh-site/forrest.properties</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Set the <code>ANT_OPTS</code> environment variable before you run
          forrest. The exact value you set it to is dependant on your JVM, but
          something like <code>ANT_OPTS=-Xmx500M</code> will probably work.
        </p>
      </section><section id="debug"><title>1.13.  How can I start forrest in Java debug mode? </title>
        <p>
          The <code>forrest.jvmargs</code> property in the
          <code>forrest.properties</code> file can be used to start forrest in
          debug mode on a specific port. <code>forrest.jvmargs=-Xdebug
          -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n</code>
        </p>
      </section></section><section id="content_faqs"><title>2. Content Creation</title><section id="edit-content"><title>2.1. What tools can be used to edit the content?</title>
        <p>
          If you are using the Apache Forrest XML
          <link href="site:dtd-docs">document format</link> or DocBook or other
          XML document types, then you can use any text editor or even a
          dedicated XML editor. You must ensure valid XML. See our
          <link href="site:catalog">configuration notes</link> for
          various editors.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are content management systems like
          <link href="ext:lenya">Apache Lenya</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that Forrest can also use other source formats, such as
          OpenOffice.org docs or JSPWiki. Use the appropriate editor for those
          document types and ensure that the document stucture is consistent.
          Forrest can also use "html" as the source format, in which case you
          can use text editors or "html editors" such as the one provided with
          the Mozilla web browser.
        </p>
      </section><section id="site-xml"><title>2.2. 
        How to use the <code>site.xml</code> configuration file for menus and linking.
      </title>
        <p>
          The <code>site.xml</code> configuration file is used for two different
          purposes: defining the navigation menus, and as a method for defining
          references to be used when linking between documents. This file is
          fully explained in <link href="site:linking">Menus and Linking</link>.
          Here is a precis:
        </p>
        <p>
          The labels can be whatever text you want.
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;faq label="FAQs" href="faq.html"&gt;
  &lt;tech label="Technical" href="faq-tech.html"&gt;
    &lt;docbook href="#docbook"/&gt;
    &lt;ignoring_javadocs href="#ignoring_javadocs"/&gt;
  &lt;/tech&gt;
  &lt;user label="User" href="faq-user.html"&gt;
&lt;/faq&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          That will create a menu like this with three links:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">FAQs
   Technical
   User</source>
        <p>
          These documents can be linked to from other documents, like this:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;a href="site:faq/tech"&gt; link to the top of the Tech FAQs
&lt;a href="site:faq/tech/docbook"&gt; link to the DocBook FAQ in the Tech FAQs
        </source>
        <p>
          If that "docbook" entry was a unique name in your site.xml then you
          can shorten that latter link:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;a href="site:docbook"&gt; link to the DocBook FAQ in the Tech FAQs
        </source>
      </section><section id="examples"><title>2.3. 
        Where are examples of documents and site.xml and tabs.xml files?
      </title>
        <p>
          There are examples in the 'forrest seed site' and also the Forrest
          website documents are included with the distribution (<code>cd
          forrest/site-author; forrest run</code>).
        </p>
      </section><section id="crawler"><title>2.4. 
        Help, one of my documents is not being rendered.
      </title>
        <p>
          Did you make a link to it? Forrest does not find documents by scanning
          the filesystem to find the source documents. Rather it starts at one
          document and crawls the links to find other documents to process.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are essentially two ways to create links. Via a site.xml file to
          define the navigation and menu structure, or via direct relative
          linking. See the to previous FAQs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally the source material will be local. The Forrest crawler does
          not follow and process off-site links. The new locationmap (0.8+)
          enables content to be drawn from remote sources.
        </p>
      </section><section id="PDF-output"><title>2.5. How can I generate one pdf-file out of the whole site or selected pages of the site?</title>
        <p>
          Add the following entries to your site.xml file.
          Note that the href must be exactly "wholesite" or "site" which triggers
          a special match in the sitemap to aggregate all documents.
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;about tab="home" label="About" href=""&gt;
 	  ...
    &lt;all_site label="Full HTML" href="wholesite.html"/&gt;    
    &lt;all_sitePDF label="Full PDF" href="wholesite.pdf"/&gt;  
     ...
  &lt;/about&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          In this case the menu labeled "About" will have 2 new items: "Full
          PDF" and "Full HTML".
        </p>
        <p>
          See also <link href="site:pdf-tab">How to
          create a PDF document for each tab</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This assumes that you use the
          <link href="site:linking">site.xml</link> method for your site
          structure and navigation, rather than the old book.xml method.
        </p>
        <warning>
          There are many issues with the "wholesite" aggregation. Search the
          issue tracker and mail lists.
        </warning>
      </section><section id="pageBreaks"><title>2.6. How do I insert page breaks into documents?</title>
        <p>
          Page breaks do not make a great deal of sense in HTML documents
          intended for display on a screen. However, PDF documents are intended
          for printing and therefore page breaks can be important.
        </p>
        <p>
          To insert a page break in a PDF document simply add
          <em>pageBreakBefore</em> and/or <em>pageBreakAfter</em> to the class
          attribute of the block you wish to force a page break on. All the
          common block grouping elements support this class, for example, note,
          warning, p and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want these classes to be processed in your HTML documents as
          well you should add the following to the <code>extra-css</code>
          element in your projects <code>skinconf.xml</code>
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve"> 
          .pageBreakBefore { 
            margin-bottom: 0; 
            page-break-before: always; 
          } 
          .pageBreakAfter {
            margin-bottom: 0; 
            page-break-after: always;

        author-element)?</title>
        <p>
          You would override <code>
          $FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/skins/common/xslt/html/document-to-html.xsl</code>
          and edit the "headers/authors" template.
        </p>
      </section><section id="link_raw"><title>2.8. How do I link to raw files such as config.txt and brochure.pdf? </title>
        <p>
          Handling of raw files was significantly changed in Forrest 0.7. See
          <link href="site:v0.70//upgrading_07/raw">Upgrading to Apache Forrest
          0.7</link> for all the details.

      </section><section id="pdf_images"><title>2.9. Images don't display in PDFs. How do I fix this?</title>
        <p>
          Forrest uses <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</link>
          for rendering PDFs. FOP cannot handle all image types natively, and
          requires third-party jars to be added. FOP natively handles BMP, GIF,
          JPG, TIFF and EPS (with a few limitations). FOP can also handle SVG
          (via Batik) and PNG (see below). For details, see
          <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/graphics.html">FOP
          Graphics formats</link>
        </p>
        <p>
          To get PNGs working in PDFs with Jimi:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download Jimi from <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/">http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/</link></li>
          <li>Unpack the Jimi distribution and copy JimiProClasses.zip to
              <code>$FORREST/lib/optional/jimi-1.0.jar</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Alternatively you can use JAI (Java Advanced Imaging API at
          <code>http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai</code>). For more
          info, see

      </section><section id="tab-index"><title>2.10.  The tab link in my site incorrectly assumes that 'index.html' is present in the
        linked-to directory. How do I fix this? </title>
        <p>
          In <code>tabs.xml</code>, use @href instead of @dir, and omit the
          trailing '/'. Which file to serve is then a concern of the sitemap.
          For example, if the "User Manual" tab should link to
          <code>manual/Introduction.html</code> then <code>tabs.xml</code>
          should contain:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;tab label="User Manual" href="manual"/&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          and add this rule to the sitemap:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;map:match pattern="manual"&gt;
    &lt;map:redirect-to uri="manual/Introduction.html"/&gt;

        <p>
          To change the default file name from 'index.html' (default) to
          'overview.html' you need to make the following changes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Create a '<link href="#cli-xconf">cli.xconf</link>' file for your project </li>
          <li> Edit that file to replace 'index.html' in
            &lt;default-filename&gt;index.html&lt;/default-filename&gt;
            with 'overview.html'. </li>
          <li> Edit your project's <link href="site:project-sitemap">sitemap.xmap</link> file. </li>
          <li> Add the following code just before the end of the pipelines-element:<source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;map:pipeline&gt;
    &lt;map:match type="regexp" pattern="^.+/$"&gt;
       &lt;map:redirect-to uri="overview.html"/&gt;

      </section><section id="defaultStartPage"><title>2.13.  How can I use a start-up-page other than index.html? </title>
        <p>
          Forrest by default assumes that the first page (home page) of your
          site is named index.html. Which is good because most web servers are
          configured to look for index.html when you call a url like
          http://myserver
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most settings in Forrest however this can be changed, for example
          when you want your start-up-page for a CD-based documentation project
          to be named 'start.html'.
        </p>
        <p>
          To change the start page of a site:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Edit your project's <link href="site:project-sitemap">sitemap.xmap</link> file.</li>
          <li>Add the following code just before the end of the pipelines-element:<source xml:space="preserve">

            </source></li>
          <li>Name the uri-attribute whatever you'd like your start page to be.</li>

        <p>
          Use the power of the Cocoon sitemaps. There is default handling for *.php (see main/webapp/sitemap.xmap) to map the 'php' extension to an internal request for "html". See more about <link href="#php">PHP</link> below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the same internal re-direction technique for your special needs, e.g. copy that php match to your project sitemap and use ".htm" instead.

      </section><section id="php"><title>2.15.  How to generate pages ready for serving via PHP? </title>

&amp;ouml;
          </code> use <code>
&amp;#246;
          </code>

      </section><section id="encoding"><title>2.17. Does Forrest handle accents for non-English languages?</title>
        <p>
          Yes, Forrest can process text in any language, so you can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>accents: á é í ó ú</li>
          <li>diereses: ä ë ï ö ü</li>
          <li>tildes: ã ñ &#297; õ &#361;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is because sources for Forrest docs are XML documents, which can
          include any of these, provided the encoding declared by the XML doc
          matches the actual encoding used in the file. For example if you
          declare the default encoding:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          but the file content is actually using ISO-8859-1 then you will
          receive validation errors, especially if you include some non-ASCII
          characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          This situation is commonly encountered when you edit the templates
          created by <code>forrest seed</code> with your favorite (probably
          localized) editor without paying attention to the encoding, or when
          you create a new file and simply copy the headers from another file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although UTF-8 is an encoding well-suited for most languages, it is
          not usually the default in popular editors or systems. In UNIX-like
          systems, most popular editors can handle different encodings to write
          the file in disk. With some editors the encoding of the file is
          preserved, while with others the default is used regardless of the
          original encoding. In most cases the encoding used to write files can
          be controlled by setting the environment variable <code>LANG</code> to
          an appropriate value, for instance:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">[localhost]$ export LANG=en_US.UTF-8</source>
        <p>
          Of course the <em>appropriate</em> way to set the encoding depends on
          the editor/OS, but ultimately relys on the user preferences. So you
          can use the encoding you prefer, as long as the <code>encoding</code>
          attribute of the XML declaration matches the actual encoding of the
          file. This means that if you are not willing to abandon ISO-8859-1 you
          can always use the following declaration instead:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          Another option is to use "character entities" such as <code>
&amp;ouml;
          </code> (ö) or the numeric form <code>
&amp;#246;
          </code> (ö).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another related issue is that your webserver needs to send http
          headers with the matching charset definitions to the html page.

        <p>
          By default Forrest does not clean its build directories in the project
          workspaces. This enables Cocoon to use its disk cache to speed up
          successive runs of forrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing 'forrest clean-site' will remove the contents of the project's
          generated documents directory. Doing 'forrest clean-work' will remove
          the project's work directories (usually build/tmp and build/webapp
          which include the Cocoon cache and the Cocoon logs). Doing 'forrest
          clean' will remove both sections.

&lt;!--
            If you want JTidy to clean up your HTML source, then use a

          element name and @description attribute for each node.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the Forrest project's <link href="site:linkmap">Site

        <p>
          Because we are based on Apache Cocoon, a lot of the functionality is
          provided behind-the-scenes, i.e. we use Cocoon's sitemaps and sitemap
          components such as XSLT transformers. So there is not much need for
          Java code in Forrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Forrest developers who want to explore or enhance that code, see
          the Apache Cocoon SVN trunk. From time-to-time we update Forrest's
          packaged version of Cocoon and so can include your contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, you will find some Java code in Forrest at main/java/...
          for Cocoon components that have been developed at Forrest, e.g.
          Locationmap and Dispatcher. There is also Java code for some plugins
          with specialised purpose, e.g. PhotoGallery.
        </p>
      </section><section id="populate-cache"><title>3.2. How to enhance the responsiveness of the cache?</title>
        <p>
          Apache Cocoon has a sophisticated cache. When running Forrest in
          dynamic mode, the initial visitor will receive slower response. The
          very first page served will cause Cocoon to cache the pipelines. Later
          requests will re-use those cached components and add others to the
          cache. A good technique is to warm up the cache after the forrest
          webapp has been re-started. Requesting the front page alone will
          populate the cache with the common items used for other pages. Using a
          spider such as wget, will warm up everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cocoon cache and sitemaps can be tuned. See
          <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/performancetips.html">Cocoon
          Performance Tips</link> and
          <link href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/CocoonPerformance">CocoonPerformance</link>

          main/webapp/WEB-INF/cocoon.xconf
        </p>
        <p>
          Responsiveness can be further enhanced by utilising a transparent
          proxy server, e.g. Apache HTTP Server as a frontend. See

        <p>
          Forrest uses a configuration file to control the processing done by
          the Apache Cocoon command-line called cli.xconf
        </p>
        <p>
          Your project can supply its own <code>cli.xconf</code> and define
          patterns for URIs to exclude. There are also other powerful
          configuration features.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means creating a directory <code>src/documentation/conf</code>
          (or wherever <code>${forrest.conf-dir}</code> points) and copying
          <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cli.xconf</code> to it.
          Declare the location of this file in the forrest.properties
          configuration, e.g.
          <code>project.configfile=${project.home}/src/documentation/conf/cli.xconf</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then edit cli.xconf, and add any exclude sections that you require.
          The default cli.xconf ignores directory links and links containing
          'apidocs' or starting with 'api/':

      </section><section id="xsp"><title>3.16. How do I enable <acronym title="eXtensible Server Pages">XSP</acronym> processing?</title>
        <p>
          First consider whether your needs would be better met by Cocoon
          itself, rather than Forrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, there are valid reasons for wanting programmatically
          generated content, so here is how to enable XSP:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cocoon/trunk/lib/optional/">jdtcore-*.jar</link> from Cocoons SVN tree, and copy it to the $FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib
            directory (or lib/core/ directory in the source distribution).</li>
          <li><p>
              Add the following generator definition in the map:generators
              section of your
              <link href="site:project-sitemap">project
              sitemap</link>
            </p>
            <source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;map:generator name="serverpages"
     pool-grow="2" pool-max="32" pool-min="4"
     src="org.apache.cocoon.generation.ServerPagesGenerator"/&gt;
            </source></li>
          <li><p>
              Decide how you want to use XSP. For single files, you could just
              define a *.xml matcher:
            </p>
            <source xml:space="preserve">

&lt;map:match pattern="dynamic.xml"&gt;
  &lt;map:generate src="content/xdocs/dynamic.xsp" type="serverpages"/&gt;
  ...
  &lt;map:serialize type="xml"/&gt;
&lt;/map:match&gt;
            </source>
            <p>
              You may instead wish to override forrest.xmap to define a general
              mapping for XSPs.
            </p></li>
        </ol>

        </p>
      </section><section id="breadcrumbs"><title>3.17. How do breadcrumbs work? Why don't they work locally?</title>
        <p>
          Breadcrumbs begin with up to three URLs specified in
          <code>skinconf.xml</code>. Here is what the Forrest site uses:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve">

  &lt;trail&gt;
    &lt;link1 name="apache" href="http://www.apache.org/"/&gt;
    &lt;link2 name="forrest" href="http://forrest.apache.org/"/&gt;
    &lt;link3 name="" href=""/&gt;
  &lt;/trail&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          If any links are blank, they are not used. After these first links,
          JavaScript looks at the URL for the current page and makes a link for
          each directory after the domain. If you are viewing the site locally,
          there is no domain and so there will be no extra breadcrumbs, only the
          ones that are specified in <code>skinconf.xml</code>.
        </p>
      </section><section id="run_port"><title>3.18. How do I make <code>forrest run</code> listen on a different port?</title>
        <p>
          <code>forrest run -Dforrest.jvmargs="-Djetty.port=80"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Or copy Forrest's main/webapp/jettyconf.xml file to your project's
          src/documentation directory and set the port number in that file. Then
          do <code>forrest run</code>
        </p>
      </section><section id="debugging"><title>3.19. Can I run Forrest with Java debugging turned on?</title>
        <p>
          If you use an IDE like Eclipse and want to debug java code in Forrest
          you need to start Forrest with debugging mode turned on. To do this
          you need to add <code>-Xdebug
          -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,susp end=n</code>
          to the <code>forrest.jvmargs</code> property in the
          <code>forrest.properties</code> file. Don't forget to ensure the
          property is uncommented in that file.
        </p>
      </section><section id="checksums"><title>3.20. How do I enable Cocoon's document checksum feature?</title>
        <p>
          Why might you want to do this? There is really no effect on Cocoon
          processing, but a little time can be saved on filesystem writes, which
          will accumulate to a big savings for a site with thousands of files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some tools depend on the "date-last-modified" timestamp of the
          generated files. For example, the Forrestbot will then deploy only the
          modified files.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was some discussion about this on the Forrest developer mailing
          list:
          <link href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=forrest-dev&amp;s=cocoon+checksum">Cocoon
          Checksum</link> Specifically note that this feature only stops Cocoon
          from writing to disk if the new file is the same as the existing file.
          Cocoon still spends the same amount of time generating the content as
          it would if checksums were not enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Locate the <code>checksums-uri</code> tag within cli.xconf and replace
          the contents with an absolute path and filename for the checksums
          file. Projects can supply their own (see FAQ:
          <link href="#cli-xconf">Cocoon cli.xconf</link>) or use the default
          installation-wide cli.xconf file.
        </p>
      </section><section id="sitemap-entities"><title>3.21. How to configure some Cocoon sitemap components, e.g. output html encoding or doctype?</title>
        <p>
          The core Cocoon components are defined in the
          <code>main/webapp/sitemap.xmap</code> file. Normally the default
          settings are suitable. There are some things that you might like to
          change per project. For example, change the html encoding for output
          html files from the default UTF-8 or configure a different document
          type declaration for the Dispatcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create a fresh site with 'forrest seed' and see the set of symbols at the 
          <code>src/documentation/resources/schema/symbols-project-v10.ent</code> file.
          Copy that file to your own projects at the same location. Also add the
          entry to your project xml catalog as shown in the seed site at
          <code>src/documentation/resources/schema/catalog.xcat</code> file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now copy the particular entity that you wish to re-define from
          <code>main/webapp/resources/schema/entity/symbols-core-v10.ent</code>
          file into your project symbols file and edit the entity declaration.
          Re-start Forrest.

        <p>
          Certain patterns are claimed by the default sitemaps for special
          processing. These include: <code>site, changes, todo, faq, images,
          my-images, skinconf, community, howto</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes there are workarounds, e.g. faq.html or faq-interview.html
          would fail, but interview-faq.html would be fine. In future versions
          of Forrest we will attempt to deal with this issue
          (<link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-217">FOR-217</link>).

      </section></section><section id="general"><title>5. General</title><section id="generating_menus"><title>5.1. What is the relationship between <code>site.xml</code> and <code>book.xml</code>? </title>
        <p>
          One <code>site.xml</code> file in your project root can replace all the book.xml files
          (one per directory) in your site. Internally, Forrest uses <code>site.xml</code> to
          dynamically generate book.xml files. However, Forrest first checks for
          the existence of a book.xml file, so backwards-compatibility is
          preserved. If a directory has a book.xml file, the book.xml will be
          used to generate the menu. This supplement is useful in situations
          where <code>site.xml</code>-generated menus aren't appropriate. See
          <link href="site:linking">Menus and Linking</link>.
        </p>
      </section><section id="docbook"><title>5.2.  How do I use DocBook as the XML documentation format? </title>
        <p>
          There are two ways. Forrest has a <code>simplifiedDocbook</code>
          plugin which can transform the DocBook format into the Forrest "xdocs"
          format on-the-fly and then render that as normal Forrest documents. Be
          aware that the stylesheet that does this transformation is
          deliberately very limited and does not attempt to deal with all
          DocBook elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other way is to use the full DocBook stylesheets directly. The
          DocBook DTDs are shipped with Forrest and automatically handled.
          However, you will need to have the DocBook stylesheets on your system
          (they are too massive to ship with Forrest) and configure Forrest
          accordingly. You will need to create a
          <link href="site:project-sitemap">project sitemap</link> as explained
          in <link href="site:your-project">Using Forrest</link> and add matches
          to handle your DocBook documents. Here is an example. Note that you
          need to change it to suit your situation. The match must be very
          specific so that only the DocBook documents are matched. The rest of
          the documents will be handled by Forrest core. Powerful regex
          capabilities are available.
        </p>

 &lt;/map:pipelines&gt;
&lt;/map:sitemap&gt;
        </source>
        <p>
          You need to define the xhtml serializer used in &lt;map:serialize
          type="xhtml"/&gt; in the components section of the sitemap. See the
          <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/serializers/xhtml-serializer.html">Cocoon
          docs</link> for the elements you need to add to define this component.
          You can see examples of other components being added in the
          <code>FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/sitemap.xmap</code> file. Alternatively
          use the "html" DocBook stylesheets and the default Cocoon serializer,
          i.e. &lt;map:serialize type="html"/&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          The output of the above sitemap will be plain html not adorned with a
          Forrest theme and navigation. If instead you need the latter, then use
          the following technique instead. This transforms DocBook xml to html,
          then uses a Forrest core stylesheet to transform and serialize to the
          internal xml format, then the normal machinery takes over and does the
          output transformation. This use the Content Aware Pipelines
          (<link href="site:cap">SourceTypeAction</link>) to peek at the source
          xml. If it is DocBook-4.2 then this sitemap match is triggered, if not
          then it falls through to the core of Forrest.

          You can also use a mixture of the methods, some handled automatically

          have a mixture of source files as "document-v*" DTD and DocBook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ensure that the document type declaration in your XML instance is well
          specified. Use a public identifier. The DTD will then be properly

        set? </title>
        <p>
          Do <code>'forrest -projecthelp'</code> or <code>'./build.sh'</code> to
          find the version number.
        </p>
        <p>
          To list the properties, add "forrest.echo=true" to your
          forrest.properties file and watch the build messages. Doing
          <code>'forrest -v'</code> will provide verbose build messages.
        </p>
      </section><section id="logs"><title>5.4.  Where are the log files to find more infomation about errors? </title>
        <p>
          The logfiles are at <code>build/webapp/WEB-INF/logs/</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          The log level can be raised with the <code>logkit.xconf</code>
          configuration. If you are using Forrest in the interactive webapp mode
          (which is generally easiest for debugging errors) then see the
          <code>main/webapp/WEB-INF/logkit.xconf</code> file. If you are
          generating a static site (with command-line 'forrest') then copy
          <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/logkit.xconf</code> to your
          project at <code>src/documentation/conf/logkit.xconf</code> and modify
          it. See more information and efficiency tips with
          <link href="http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/ExploringTheLogs">Cocoon
          logging</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing <code>'forrest -v'</code> will provide verbose build messages to
          the standard output.
        </p>
      </section><section id="verbose-ant"><title>5.5.  How to filter or reduce the standard output messages? </title>
        <p>
          Where normally you would do 
          <code>'forrest'</code> or <code>'forrest run'</code> etc. instead use
          the "quiet" option, and do 
          <code>'forrest -q'</code> or <code>'forrest -q run'</code> etc.
          If errors are reported, then drop the "quiet" option and run again to
          get the context for the error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing <code>'forrest -v'</code> will provide very verbose build messages to
          the standard output.

      </section><section id="coloured-ant"><title>5.6.  How to enabled coloured standard output messages? </title>
        <p>
          Adding colour to the forrest output messages will greatly assist
          readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set the ANT_ARGS environment variable like so:<br/>
          <code>export ANT_ARGS="$ANT_ARGS -logger org.apache.tools.ant.listener.AnsiColorLogger"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          To change the default colours, set the ANT_OPTS environment variable
          like so:<br/>
          <code>export ANT_OPTS="$ANT_OPTS -Dant.logger.defaults=$FORREST_HOME/etc/AnsiColorLogger.properties"</code><br/>
          and create that configuration file as
          <link href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/listeners.html#AnsiColorLogger">explained</link>
          in the Apache Ant Manual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that not all terminals support ANSI color codes.

      </section><section id="jobs"><title>5.9.  How can job positions be advertised? </title>
        <p>
          Employers can send notices about employment opportunities. There is a
          special jobs&lt;AT&gt;apache.org mailing list. You can also send these
          notices to the project mailing lists, e.g. dev list at Forrest or
          Cocoon (add [jobs] to the subject line). You can also approach
          particular developers off-list. However only genuine jobs, not pleas
          for free support (see <link href="site:mail-lists">mailing
          lists</link>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some enlightened employers enable their employees to contribute
          material which was created during work time using work-related
          resources. Please note the need to file a Corporate Contributor
          License Agreement
