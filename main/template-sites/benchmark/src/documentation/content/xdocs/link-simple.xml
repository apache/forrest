        Apache Forrest&trade; software is a publishing framework that transforms
        input from various sources into a unified presentation in one or more
        output formats. The modular and extensible plug-in architecture of
        Apache Forrest is based on Apache Cocoon and the relevant industry
        standards that separate presentation from content. Forrest can generate
        static documents, or be used as a dynamic server, or be deployed by its
        automated facility.
