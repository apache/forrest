    <title>Using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      Forrest can deliver raw SVG files for capable browsers, e.g. Firefox. See
      <a href="ellipse.svg">example</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forrest can convert SVG files into Portable Network Graphic (PNG). See
      <a href="ellipse.png">example</a>. Note that Forrest will first look for a
      pre-prepared PNG file, and if not found then it will generate the PNG from
      the SVG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be careful. We only provide a local copy of the SVG 1.0 DTD so if you use
      SVG 1.1 then there will be network trips for the DTDs.
      <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/docs/dev/validation.html#catalog">Configure</a>
      your local catalog entity resolver for your local DTD copies.
