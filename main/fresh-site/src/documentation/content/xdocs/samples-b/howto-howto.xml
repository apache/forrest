  <purpose title="Purpose">
    <p>
      These guidelines are based on successful how-to document structures used
      by other open source projects with diverse author groups. Following these
      tried and true guidelines will help to ensure the effectiveness of your
      work.
    </p>
  </purpose>
  <prerequisites title="Prerequisites">
    <p>
      How-To authors should have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A unique How-To topic, related to using Forrest, which fulfills a
      specific need. Look at existing How-Tos to find a niche for your work.
      Consider posting your idea for the How-To to user mailing list, to make
      sure another author's draft is not already in process.</li>
      <li>A sufficient ability in English to write the document. However, we would
      rather that you just make a start, as the community can help to
      fine-tune the document.</li>
      <li>Copy this template document "howto-howto.xml" to be modified with
      your own content as necessary.</li>
      <li>An understanding of the How-To document structure. Just use this
      template document and you will be safe.
      Make sure you run '<code>forrest validate-xdocs</code>' before
      contributing your document.</li>
    </ul>
  </prerequisites>
  <steps title="Steps">
    <p>
      Here is how to proceed.
    </p>
    <section id="overview">
      <title>Write the Overview</title>
      <p>
        An overview helps potential readers to determine quickly if a particular
        How-To matches their interests or needs. In a few sentences, summarize
        the main points of your How-To. Make sure to include any critical
        definitions which will help readers evaluate the utility of your How-To.
        Consider writing the overview last, after you have completed all other
        sections.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="audience">
      <title>Describe your Intended Audience</title>
      <p>
        If your How-To is targetted at a specific audience, describe it here.
        For example, potential readers will have different levels of skill using
        Forrest. They will also bring different areas of expertise and
        backgrounds to their How-To learning experience. When you clarify your
        target audience up front, you will save all other readers time and
        confusion.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="purpose">
      <title>State the Purpose</title>
      <p>
        State the purpose of your How-To. Explain how the reader will benefit by
        reading it. Give your reader an incentive or two to continue.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="prerequisites">
      <title>List any Prerequisites</title>
      <p>
        Inform your reader about any required knowledge, configuration, or
        resources they may need before stepping through your How-To. Assist them
        in this preparation by linking to other useful resources on the Forrest
        site or the web. Helping your readers to prepare increases the
        likelihood that they will continue reading your How-To.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="steps">
      <title>Describe the Steps of your How-To</title>
      <p>
        In a precise, step-by-step approach, walk your reader through the
        process. Make sure your reader can reproduce your intended result by
        following your exact steps. Make the learning process efficient by
        supplying sample code snippets or configuration details as necessary.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="extension">
      <title>Extend the Learning</title>
      <p>
        Provide your reader with a few real-world examples of how the techniques
        or capabilities gained from your How-To could be applied. Reward the
        reader for successfully completing the How-To with a few ideas about how
        it will pay off.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="summarize">
      <title>Summarize the Entire Process</title>
      <p>
        In a few sentences, remind the reader what they have just learned. This
        helps to reinforce the main points of your How-To.
      </p>

        <question>What is the difference between a How-To and a
        tutorial?</question>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The goal of a How-To is to help the reader to accomplish a specific
            task with clear and consise instructions. While tutorials may
            contain How-To-like instructions and content, they also include
            additional background and conceptual content to help teach their
            readers higher order concepts along the way. How-Tos are concerned
            about filling an immediate, short-term need. Tutorials often provide
            long-term knowledge which can be applied across a range of needs.
