    <title>Process xml source documents without DTD declaration</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      The xml source documents that have a Document Type Declaration using
      a Public Identifier are automatically handled by the <code>forrest.xmap</code>
      sitemap using the <a href="ext:forrest/cap">SourceTypeAction (Content Aware Pipelines)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a DTD is not always desirable, so another mechanism is needed to
      detect the content type. SourceTypeAction can instead use various other
      techniques. One way is to detect an xml "Processing Instruction".
    </p>
    <p>
      The source for this current document starts like this ...
    </p>
    <source>
<![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?schema apache.org/forrest/schema/xdoc/document/2.0?>
<document>
  <header>
    ...]]></source>
    <p>
      Note that there is no space before the closing of the processing-instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, a howto document is declared like this ...
    </p>
    <source>
<![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?schema apache.org/forrest/schema/xdoc/howto/2.0?>
<howto>
  <header>
    ...]]></source>
    <p>
      Such documents are not validated by 'forrest validate-xdocs'. Instead see
      <a href="ext:forrest/dev/debug-validation">Using Cocoon Validation Transformers</a>.
