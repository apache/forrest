    <title>Using XML entities for character replacements</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      All of the normal xml character entities are available for use in your
      source documents. So you can use "<code>&amp;trade;</code>" for the
      trademark symbol (&trade;) and use "<code>&amp;ouml;</code>" for special
      accents (&ouml;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Forrest also has some default sets of symbols. There is one set for the
      core of Forrest. These are automatically available for use in the
      "document-v*" series of document types. (If you want to use them in
      another document type, then you need to specify them in the document type
      declaration of your xml instance documents or in your custom DTD. See
      below.)
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, use "<code>&amp;for-s;</code>" to represent the strong text
      string "&for-s;". See the list of available symbols at
      <code>main/webapp/resources/schema/entity/symbols-core-v10.ent</code>
      which shows that that example entity was declared as <code>
<![CDATA[<strong>Apache Forrest</strong>]]>
      </code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can supply lists of symbols for your own project too. Create a fresh
      site with 'forrest seed' and see the set
      <code>src/documentation/resources/schema/symbols-project-v10.ent</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, use "<code>&amp;myp-t;</code>" to represent the project name
      together with trademark symbol "&myp-t;".
    </p>
    <p>
      The set of project symbols is already configured. To use the symbols in
      your documents, add to the document type declaration. For example, see the
      source for this document
      (<code>src/documentation/content/xdocs/samples/xml-entites.xml</code>)
      which declares the project symbol set ...
