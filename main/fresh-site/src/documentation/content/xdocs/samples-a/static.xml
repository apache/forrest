      <p>
        You can place some types of raw content into the xdocs directory. For
        example, you can place a PDF file in
        <code>src/documentation/content/xdocs</code> and link to it normally,
        <strong>&lt;a
        href="../hello.pdf"&gt;</strong><a href="../hello.pdf">hello.pdf</a><strong>&lt;/a&gt;</strong>
        However, note that if the file is one that Forrest is able to process,
        for example an HTML file, these files will be processed accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also worth noting that files in the xdocs directory will only be
        copied into your final site if there is a link to them somewhere in the
        site. See the next section for details of how to include content that is
        not linked.
      </p>

      <title>Including Static Content that is Not Linked</title>
      <p>
        You can include raw HTML, PDFs, plain-text, and other files. In your
        final site by placing them in the <code>src/documentation/content</code>
        directory. Files in this directory will be copied over automatically but
        will not be processed in any way by Forrest, that is they will be linked
        to as raw files.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also have sub-directories such as
        <code>src/documentation/content/samples/subdir/</code> which reflects
        your main <code>xdocs/</code> tree. The raw files will then end up
        beside your documents.
