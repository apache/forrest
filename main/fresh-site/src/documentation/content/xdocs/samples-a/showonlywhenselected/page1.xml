      <title>Always Visible</title>
      <note>
        This feature requires the use of the 'scales'-skin. Used in any other
        skin, both pages will show normally.
      </note>
      <p>
        This page is always visible and just another Forrest document.

      <p>
        The link below (please read on!) opens the second page of this demo.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also referenced in site.xml, but, because if the type-attribute
        "showWhenSelected", it will not normally appear on the menu. Unless you
        follow the <a href="page2.html">link</a> and select it.
