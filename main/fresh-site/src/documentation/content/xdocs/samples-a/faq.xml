          This project uses <a href="ext:forrest">Apache Forrest</a> to generate
          documentation from XML. Please download a copy of Forrest, which can
          be used to <a
            href="ext:forrest/validation">validate</a>,
          <a
            href="ext:forrest/webapp">develop</a> and render a

      <question>
	How do I enable MOTD?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          There is example MOTD code in /src/documentation/skinconf.xml. Enable
          this and make sure the motd-option pattern URI points to the page or
          pages you want the message to appear.
