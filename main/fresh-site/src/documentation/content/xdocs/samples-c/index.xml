      <title>Samples 2 Documentation Overview</title>
      <p>
              Samples are currently split into two areas. This is purely to help
              envisage and document by example the usage of tabs and sub-tabs.
              One section is no more important than the other.
      </p>
      <ul>
              <li>The Navigation Menu will show documentation contained in the 'samples-c' directory.</li>
              <li>The Navigation highlights the current page. (This index.html page has a label of 'Overview')</li>
              <li>The current selected 'Tab' will show 'Samples'.</li>
              <li>The current selected 'SubTab' will show 'Samples 2'</li>
