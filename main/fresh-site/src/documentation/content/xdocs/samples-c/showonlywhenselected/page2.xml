      <note>
        This feature requires the use of the 'scales'-skin. Used in any other
        skin, both pages will show normally.
      </note>
      <p>
        This page will only become visible on the menu when it is already the
        current page. Since it doesn't normally appear on the menu, this can
        only happen, if you link to it from another page or from another site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open another page by menu-selection or follwing a
        <a href="page1.html">link</a> to make this page disappear from this
        menu.
