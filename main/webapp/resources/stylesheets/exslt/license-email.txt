The license situation for EXSLT is not absolutely clear. This email seems to be
the clearest answer.

I'm catching up on EXSLT e-mail and I'm very sorry that none of the
managers has responded to your question.

You're free and clear to use the templates, but you should credit and
link to exslt.org.  As for copyright, there is no legal entity for
EXSLT, but you can credit the original individual managers as follows:

EXSLT templates are Copyright 2001-2004 Jeni Tennison, David Pawson,
James Fuller and Uche Ogbuji

There is no "license" as such, although I started discussion for
choosing one (probably a creative commons license).  You're not required
to attribute or post notice, so you'd be fine within the Apache license,
but I'd encourage you to pass on this attribution request, anyway.

Thanks.
