  ____________________________________

  This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December
  31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that
  this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the
  W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references
  to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the
  ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the
  [3]previous version and is written so as to preserve the [4]Free
  Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and [5]OSI's
  certification under the [6]Open Source Definition. Please see our
  [7]Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our
  site, including specific terms and conditions for packages like
  libwww, Amaya, and Jigsaw. Other questions about this notice can be
  directed to [8]site-policy@w3.org.
