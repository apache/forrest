Before inventing a dull name for a skin or trying to discuss it on
the dev list, remember that we have already lost time on it. We decided
to use names akin to 'skin' and stay completely away from trying to
invent names based on functionality or fanciful names.

Just pick one of these, it's easy.

If you still cannot decide, toss a dice 3 times, sum up the numbers,
and get the name that comes out.

1 fleece -> taken
2 rind
3 fur
4 hide
5 coat -> taken
6 pelt -> taken
7 peel
8 bark
9 exo
10 husk
11 dermis
12 corium -> taken
13 calyx
14 scales -> taken
15 leather -> taken
16 patina
17 crust -> taken
18 hull

We may be unable to come out with a decent name, but we sure know how 
to eliminate the problem for the next occasions in a hacky way. :-P
