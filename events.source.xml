        <title>Apache Forrest workshop on Views</title>
        <p>
          Monday 18 July commencing at 18:30 - We will go out to dinner and then
          meet for a developers workshop specifically about the new Views plugin
          development. Topics will include Views, XHTML2 internal format, and
          general project planning. Discussions will be technical and will assume
          knowledge of Forrest. We will certainly answer questions to ensure that
          people understand the background. However the main aim is an intensive
          project design session.
          The event is open to anybody, you don't need to be attending ApacheCon.
          Venue and Directions: Gather at the foyer of the ApacheCon.
