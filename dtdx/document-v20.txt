                                 ** Note **
This is a demonstration document using all possible elements in the current 
Apache Forrest xdocs document-v20.dtd (See the DTD changes [Link: #changes] 
section at the bottom.) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sample Content
==============

  Hint: See the xml source to see how the various elements are used and 
  see the DTD reference documentation [Link: 
  ../docs_0_90/../dtdx/dtd-docs.html]. 

  Block and inline elements
  -------------------------

    This is a simple paragraph. Most documents contain a fair amount of 
    paragraphs. Paragraphs are called <p>. 


          With the <p xml:space="preserve"> attribute, you can declare
          that whitespace should    be   preserved, without implying it is in any other
          way special.
        

    This next paragraph has a class attribute of 'quote'. CSS 
    (Cascading Style Sheets) can be used to present this <p 
    class='quote'> in a different style than the other paragraphs. The 
    handling of this quoted paragraph is defined in the <extra-css> 
    element in the skinconf.xml. 

    Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can 
    barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. Dey's uh, 
    shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, 
    stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, 
    pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and 
    potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it. 

    A number of in-line elements are available in the DTD, we will show 
    them inside an unordered list (<ul>): 

    * Here is a simple list item (<li>).
    * Have you seen the use of the <code> element in the previous item?
    * Also, we have <sub> and <sup> elements to show content aboveor belowthe 
      text baseline.
    * There is a facility to emphasize certain words using the <em> <strong> 
      elements.
    * We can use [Icon: feather]<icon>s too.
    * Another possibility is the <img> element: [Image: another feather], 
      which offers the ability to refer to an image map.
    * We have elements for hyperlinking: 
      :: <a href="../index.html">
         Use this to link [Link: ../index.html] to another document. As per 
         normal, this will open the new document in the same browser window.
      
      :: <a href="#section">
         Use this to link [Link: #section] to the named anchor in the current 
         document. 
      
      :: <a href="../index.html#status">
         Use this to link [Link: ../index.html#status] to another document and 
         go to the named anchor. This will open the new document in the same 
         browser window. 
      
      :: Targetted window control with jump and fork.
         See demonstration using class attribute on links [Link: #link-class]. 
      
    * Oh, by the way, a definition list <dl> was used inside the previous list item. We could put another 
      * unordered list
      * inside the list item
      A sample nested table
      +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
      | Or even tables..                | +-----------------------------+ |
      |                                 | | inside tables..             | |
      |                                 | +-----------------------------+ |
      +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
      | or inside lists, but I believe  |                                 |
      | this liberty gets quickly       |                                 |
      | quite hairy as you see.         |                                 |
      +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
      
      
      
      

    So far for the in-line elements, let's look at some paragraph-level 
    elements. 

                                ** Fixme (SN) **
    The <fixme> element is used for stuff which still needs work. Mind 
    the author attribute! 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   ** Note **
    Use the <note> element to draw attention to something, e.g. ...The 
    <code> element is used when the author can't express himself 
    clearly using normal sentences ;-) 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 ** Warning **
    Sleep deprivation can be the result of being involved in an open 
    source project. (a.k.a. the <warning> element). 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ** Important **
    If you want your own labels for notes and warnings, specify them 
    using the label attribute. 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Apart from unordered lists, we have ordered lists too, of course. 

    1. Item 1
    2. Item 2
    3. This should be 3 if my math is still OK.

  Various presentation formats
  ----------------------------

    This sample document, written in document-v20 XML can be presented 
    via Forrest in a number of different formats. The links in the 
    following list show this document in each of the currently 
    available formats. 

    Each of the formats can be made available as a link near the top of 
    the page. Actual placement of those links depends on the skin 
    currently in use. Those links are enabled in the skinconf.xml via 
    the <disable-XXX-link> elements in the skinconf.xml

    +--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
    



  Using sections
  --------------

    You can use sections to put some structure in your document. 

  Sections, the sequel
  --------------------

    Just some second section. 

    Section 2.1
    .-.-.-.-.-.

      Which contains a subsection (2.1). 

  Showing preformatted source code
  --------------------------------

    Enough about these sections. Let's have a look at more interesting 
    elements, <source> for instance: 
    
    // This example is from the book _Java in a Nutshell_ by David Flanagan.
    // Written by David Flanagan.  Copyright (c) 1996 O'Reilly & Associates.
    // You may study, use, modify, and distribute this example for any purpose.
    // This example is provided WITHOUT WARRANTY either expressed or implied.
    
    import java.applet.*;    // Don't forget these import statements!
    import java.awt.*;
    
    public class FirstApplet extends Applet {
        // This method displays the applet.
        // The Graphics class is how you do all drawing in Java.
        public void paint(Graphics g) {
            g.drawString("Hello World", 25, 50);
        }
    }


    CDATA sections are used within <source> elements so that you can 
    write pointy brackets without needing to escape them with messy 
    &lt; entities ... 
    
    
    <pointy>
      easy
    </pointy>
    
            


    Please take care to still use a sensible line-length within your 
    source elements. 

  Using tables
  ------------

    And now for a table: 
    Table caption
    +--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
    | heading cell 1     | heading cell 2     | heading cell 3     |
    +--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
    | data cell          | this data cell     |                    |
    |                    | spans two columns  |                    |
    +--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
    | Tables can be      | +----------+------ | * and can include  |
    | nested:            | ----+              |   most other       |
    |                    | | column 1 | colum |   elements         |
    |                    | n 2 |              | * such as lists    |
    |                    | +----------+------ |                    |
    |                    | ----+              |                    |
    |                    | | cell A   | cell  |                    |
    |                    | B   |              |                    |
    |                    | +----------+------ |                    |
    |                    | ----+              |                    |
    +--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
    



  Using figures
  -------------

    And a <figure> to end all of this. Note that this can also be 
    implemented with an <img> element. 
 [Figure: The fine Forrest logo]
  Using map and area
  ------------------

    [Image: usemap demo] 

    

  Using class attribute on links
  ------------------------------

    The document-v13 had elements <fork> and <jump>. In document-v20, 
    those elements no longer exist but the functionality can be 
    duplicated by using the @class attribute. Even though the opening 
    of separate windows should be under the control of the user, these 
    techniques can still be employed. 
    
    +--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
    | Document V1.3                  | Document V2.0                  |
    +--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
    | <fork href="../index.html">    | <a class="fork" href="../index |
    |                                | .html"> [Link: ../index.html]  |
    +--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
    | <jump href="../index.html">    | <a class="jump"                |
    |                                | href="../index.html"> [Link:   |
    |                                | ../index.html]                 |
    +--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
    



DTD changes
===========

  See the generated DTD reference documentation [Link: 
  ../docs_0_90/../dtdx/dtd-docs.html]. 

  Changes between document-v13 and document-v20
  ---------------------------------------------

    * Renamed <link> to <a>
    * Removed <fork> and <jump> in favour of the <a> element. See 
      demonstration using class attribute on links [Link: #link-class]. 
    * Enabled use of XInclude. See example in the 'forrest seed sample' site. 

  Changes between document-v12 and document-v13
  ---------------------------------------------

    All v1.2 docs will work fine as v1.3 DTD. The main change is the 
    addition of a @class attribute to every element, which enables the 
    "extra-css" section in the skinconf to be put to good use. 

  Changes between document-v11 and document-v12
  ---------------------------------------------

    doc-v12 enhances doc-v11 by relaxing various restrictions that were 
    found to be unnecessary. 

    * Links ((link|jump|fork) and inline elements (br|img|icon|acronym) are 
      allowed inside title. 
    * Paragraphs (p|source|note|warning|fixme), table and figure|anchor are 
      allowed inside li. 
    * Paragraphs (p|source|note|warning|fixme), lists (ol|ul|dl), table, 
      figure|anchor are allowed inside definition lists (dd) and tables (td 
      and dh). 
    * Inline content 
      (strong|em|code|sub|sup|br|img|icon|acronym|link|jump|fork) is allowed 
      in strong and em.
