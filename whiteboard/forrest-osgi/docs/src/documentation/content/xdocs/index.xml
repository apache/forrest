      <title>forrest-osgi</title>
      <p>
        You are viewing the documentation for forrest-osgi, a
        whiteboard experiment to implement Apache Forrest&#153;
        document transformation services based on modular OSGi&#153;
        concepts. This particular experiment uses the Apache
        Felix&#153; framework, but with slight modification the
        implementation can be framework provider-agnostic.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many ways to leverage OSGi in a project like this
        one; this attempt is by no means the only way to approach the
        subject. The documentation also does not cover OSGi itself at
        any great length.
      </p>
      <p>
        The documentation is divided into sections based on the
        following questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What is the same? Show me around based on how Forrest 0.9 works.
        </li>
        <li>
          What is not the same? Show me around based on how
          forrest-osgi works.
        </li>
        <li>
          How do I contribute? Show me how to get on with business
          using forrest-osgi.
        </li>
      </ul>

        There is still the concept of core functionality supplemented
        by a set of plugins. The modularity provided, and enforced, by
        OSGi bundles has the characteristics necessary to form the
        basis of a plugin architecture. The communication link
        provided by the Apache Cocoon&#153; sitemap is handled by OSGi
        services.

        forrest-osgi is not based on Cocoon and this has a handful of
        implications. forrest-osgi is based on OSGi concepts and this
        also has implications.

        Get involved in the experiment. Add the missing features and
        enjoy the benefits of OSGi modularity.
