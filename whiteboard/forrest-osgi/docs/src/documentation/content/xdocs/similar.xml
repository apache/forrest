        The build process and invocation methods are similar, but not
        the same. Building is done with Apache Ant&#153; and a shell
        script is used to invoke the application. See the <a
        href="site:more/different">differences</a>.

      <title>Plugins in forrest-osgi</title>
      <p>
        forrest-osgi maintains the concept of plugins. Plugins map
        nicely to the OSGi&#153; concept of <a
        href="site:more/bundle">bundles</a>, which embody the missing
        modularity of the Java&#153; platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, not every bundle in the system maps conceptually to a
        Forrest 0.9 plugin. Some bundles provide system dependencies,
        some even provide core functionality. A bundle is an excellent
        candidate as a container for a Forrest plugin, but it is not
        limited to this use.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the page on <a href="site:more/bundle">bundles</a> for
        more.

    <section id="content">
      <title>Content and transformation</title>
      <p>
        As with Forrest plugins, forrest-osgi plugins exist to support
        the gathering of content in various input formats and to
        supply that content in various output formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the current experimental implementation, the input plugin
        has the burden of reading the source and transforming it into
        an internal format. The output plugin operates on the internal
        format supplied by the input plugin, and converts the content
        into the desired output format. The workflow here is the same
        as in Forrest 0.9.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment, source content is assumed to be a local file on
        disk in Document V2.0 format.
