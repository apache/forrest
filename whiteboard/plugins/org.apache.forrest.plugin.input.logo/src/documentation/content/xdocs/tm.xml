        Without altering the source image, this plugin applies a trademark
        symbol using an SVG template, and generates a new PNG image.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="usage">
      <title>Configuration and usage</title>
      <p>
        Make your existing logo image (only PNG at this stage) available to
        one of Forrest's image directories, e.g. in your project at either
        <code>src/documentation/resources/images/</code> or
        <code>src/documentation/content/xdocs/images/</code>
        or otherwise available via Locationmap.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, this plugin has <code>images/example-logo.png</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <img width="220" height="65" src="images/example-logo.png" alt="image"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now provide an SVG template file to specify the symbol placement
        and other attributes. This file has the same basename as your source
        logo image and with "<code>-tm.svg</code>" appended.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, this plugin has <code>images/example-logo-tm.svg</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        As shown in that SVG file, specify the font, size, and x-y placement
        of the symbol. Choose between "trademark" (e.g. Foo&tm;)
        or "registered trademark" (e.g. Foo&rm;)
        or "service mark" (e.g. Foo&sm;)
        or use plain text symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
        To apply this, request the resource
        <code>.../</code><a href="example-logo-tm.png">example-logo-tm.png</a>
        and see following new generated image:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img width="220" height="65" src="example-logo-tm.png" alt="image"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tweak the SVG and re-load until the symbol placement is satisfactory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also enables use of Forrest as a tool to process a set of images.
        This might be a once-off task to handle various images for which you
        are responsible. Using Forrest in dynamic mode, these resources can be
        directly processed, while not being an actual part of your normal site
        build (e.g. <code>localhost:8888/images/example-logo-tm.png</code>).
