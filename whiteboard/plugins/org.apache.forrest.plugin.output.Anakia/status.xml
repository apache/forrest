        Developed a much better way to configure this plugin.
        See the <a href="site:about/index">overview</a> page Howto section.
        Removed the need for Dispatcher. So this plugin has no dependencies
        and can be easily applied to any site using 0.8 release or newer.

        Enable use of the .xml filename extension, rather than the current .xdoc
