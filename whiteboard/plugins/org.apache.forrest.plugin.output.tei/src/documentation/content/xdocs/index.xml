      <title>How to configure the plugin</title>
      <p>The plugin reads some proporties to control some of the variables
       at the output, as the publisher name or the contact email. The complete
       list of properties and their default value could be found at
       default.plugin.properties.xml into the plugin directory. At the moment
       the properties are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>output.tei.publisher</li>
        <li>output.tei.authority</li>
        <li>output.tei.email</li>
        <li>output.tei.licence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The variables could be modified in the forrest.properties.xml file.
      Those variables are automatically included in TEI field, in the
      <em>publicationStmt</em> section.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="referenceslist">
      <title>List of references</title>
      <p>Optionally the TEI output file could include a list of references at
      the end. This section includes all the references in the text and present
      them as a list sorted alphabetically. To enable this option it is necessary
      to add this line to your forrest.properties.xml file:</p>
      <source><![CDATA[
<property name="output.tei.reference-section" value="true"/>
]]></source>
