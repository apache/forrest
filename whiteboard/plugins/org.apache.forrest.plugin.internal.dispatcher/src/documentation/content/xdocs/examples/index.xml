    <title>Dispatcher (Draft - feature under development)</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <warning>
      The "dispatcher" is new functionality which is still in development phase.
      That is why it is in the "whiteboard" section of the Forrest distribution.
      We are working at the moment on moving this plugin from the whiteboard
      into the core plugins. Further all dispatcher related documents will be
      moved into the plugin as well. See
      <a 
      href="http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_90/status-themes.html">Status
      of Themes: Skins and Dispatcher</a>.

      <p>
              This section will grow and show example usage of contracts in action -
              either standalone contracts or those that work in conjunction with
              plugins. Contributions Welcome.

            <title>Enabling and adding the POD plugin</title>
            <p>On this page you will see a link to a .pod version of this page. Below are
               the steps taken :-</p>
       <ul><li>Add POD plugin to forrest.properties file</li>
                <li><code><![CDATA[org.apache.forrest.plugin.output.POD]]></code></li>
        <li>Add contract to include pod link - this can either be enabled in a 
                master theme file (such as pelt.fv) or on a per folder basis (by altering a
                nested pelt.fv to point to modified *.panels.xml). In this case, we want a
                modified option to only alter files in this examples folder.
</li></ul>
