    <title>Configure output serializer and doctype as xhtml or html</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      The default html output serializer for Dispatcher-based projects is the
      "xhtml" serializer and the document type declaration is "XHTML 1.0 Strict".
      That is fine for applications which require xml input. For example, running Forrest as a back-end server and some other tool utilising the forrest output.
    </p>
    <p>
      However for some websites it would be better to serve plain old html.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, simply add the following line to your project's symbols file.
      That file is at:
      <code>PROJECT_HOME/src/documentation/resources/schema/symbols-project-v10.ent</code>
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[...
<!ENTITY dispatcher-output-serializer "html">
...]]></source>
    <p>
      and then re-start Forrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output will now be serialized as "html" and the document type declaration
      will be "HTML 4.01 Transitional".
    </p>
    <note>
      If your project does not yet have a "symbols file" then follow the
      <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/faq.html#sitemap-entities">FAQ</a>.
    </note>
    <p>
      To change the document type declaration (perhaps to "Strict"), copy
      the relevant entities from the main configuration file at
      <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/resources/schema/entity/symbols-core-v10.ent</code>
      to your "symbols file" and over-ride them, i.e.
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[...
<!ENTITY serializer-html-doctype-public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
<!ENTITY serializer-html-doctype-system "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
...]]></source>
    <p>
      and then re-start Forrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In HTML, the System Identifier is optional, so it can be set to be empty: 
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[...
<!ENTITY serializer-html-doctype-public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
<!ENTITY serializer-html-doctype-system "">
...]]></source>
