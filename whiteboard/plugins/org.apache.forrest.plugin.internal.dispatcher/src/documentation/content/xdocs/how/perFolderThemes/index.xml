    <title>Per Folder/File Themes</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>It is possible to customise the theme on a per folder or per file
    basis.</p>
    <p>To do this simply add a *.fv file in the directory that you wish to
    create an alternative theme for. The name of this file must be the same as
    the theme name you are using for your site. For example, this site uses the
    "pelt" theme and the directory containing this file contains a pelt.fv file
    that customises the theme for this file (and any others that may be in this
    folder). In order to show this working we have simply stripped the PDF link
    from the theme.</p>
    <p>For demonstration purposes we also provide a 
    <a href="subFolder/index.html">subfolder</a>within this folder that has
    another modified theme.</p>
