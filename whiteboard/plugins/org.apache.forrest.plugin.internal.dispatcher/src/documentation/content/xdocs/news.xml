    <warning>The "dispatcher" is new functionality which is still in
    development phase. That is why it is in the "whiteboard" section of the
    Forrest distribution. We are working at the moment on moving this plugin
    from the whiteboard into the core plugins. Further all dispatcher related
    documents will be moved into the plugin as well. See 
    <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/docs_0_80/status-themes.html">Status of
    Themes: Skins and Dispatcher</a>.</warning>

      <title>Cleanup of the locationmap - 15.06.07</title>
      <p>The locationmap matching for the structurer needed a cleanup.
      Structurer needs to be placed now in 
      <code>${project.resources-dir}/structurer/url</code>instead of the xdocs
      directory.</p>
      <p>The following matches have been removed during this cleanup (you need
      to implement them in your project locationmap if you still want their
      behavior.</p>
