        <p>
          JIRA generates an XML file for each issue. This plugin transforms 
	  that XML file into Baetle (RDF/XML). Then, the Baetle is transformed 
	  into Forrest Document format.
	</p>
        <p>
	  The following map enables the plugin to process any issue in
	  Apache bug database.

<match pattern="baetle.bissues.*">
  <location src="https://issues.apache.org/jira/si/jira.issueviews:issue-xml/{1}/{1}.xml"/>

	<note>
          The above map is included in the 
	  <a href="ext:forrest/locationmap">locationmap</a>, 
          which is by default located in <code>{properties:content}</code>.
