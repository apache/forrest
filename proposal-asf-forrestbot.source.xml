    <title>Draft: Proposal for ASF-wide Forrestbot</title>
  </header>

  <body>
    <warning>This is a draft proposal document. It is not yet the
     consensus of ASF nor the Infrastructure committee.
    </warning>

    <section id="overview">
      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>All ASF projects need to be able to concentrate on their projects
        and the content of their websites, rather than get tangled up in
        arcane website publication procedures.
      </p>
      <p>A proposal is currently being discussed for
        <link href="http://people.apache.org/~crossley/proposal-asf-publish.html">ASF-wide documentation staging
        and publishing</link>.
      </p>
      <p>The context of this Forrestbot proposal is at
        Item C through to Item G of that infrastructure, the "staging server".
        This does not preclude other mechanisms - some projects might choose
        to use Forrestbot.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="forrestbot">
      <title>About Forrestbot</title>
      <p>The Forrestbot enables the automated building and deployment of
        websites. It will retrieve the source from SVN or CVS, build the
        website, and then deploy it. Notifications can be sent. It keeps a
        log of the build process.
        See more <link href="site:forrestbot">detailed explanation</link>.
      </p>
      <p>There is also a "web interface" component to Forrestbot to enable
        the project committers to easily trigger their website build, view
        the result, and deploy it to the staging server.
        See more <link href="site:forrestbot-web-interface">detailed explanation</link>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="requirements">
      <title>Requirements</title>
      <p>The staging server (e.g. stage.apache.org) would be a virtual server.
        A stable version of "forrest" and "forrestbot" would be installed there.
        Each project that uses forrestbot would have a forrestbot configuration
        file. This defines the SVN or CVS repository to get the source from,
        where to deploy the built site, and various other parameters.
      </p>
      <p>The Forrestbot web interface requires a servlet container (e.g.
        <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Apache Tomcat</link>) and
        an <link href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server</link> would be
        used to view the staging sites.

      <title>Demonstration</title>
      <p>
        The recent demonstration on brutus is now gone.
        Soon we will set up a new demo on our zone machine.
