  <title>How to install the "dispatcher"</title>
  <abstract>
    This How-To describes the setup of the plugins (needed to work with forrest:views and forrest:contracts) and a fresh v2 seed site.

<warning>
The "Dispatcher" (aka "Views") is new functionality which is still in development phase. That is why it is in the
"whiteboard" section of the Forrest distribution. This HowTo is a good start but still needs more work.
</warning>
    <p>
      Developers who want to get started with "dispatcher" development and want to help testing and developing the "dispatcher".
    </p>
  </section><section id="Purpose"><title>Purpose</title>
    <p>
      Quick guide installing the "dispatcher". This is the "getting started" setup guide.
    </p>
  </section><section id="Prerequisites"><title>Prerequisites</title>
    <ul>
      <li>Need the SVN trunk version of Forrest for using the "dispatcher" because it is in an early stage.</li>
      <li>Read <a href="site:v0.80//howto/buildPlugin">How to Build a Plugin</a>
        especially the section about using Forrest's own Ant.</li>
      <li>Installing a mozilla browser and the
        <a href="site:tools/forrestbar">Forrestbar</a> helps a lot in developing.</li>
    </ul>
  </section><section id="Steps"><title>Steps</title>
    <p>
      The process of setting up the plugin should be easy. Still it has too many stages and it
       will become easier in the future.
    </p>
    <section id="localBuild">
      <title>Build the internal.structurer and the output.themer plugins</title>
      <p>
        The first step is to build and deploy the internal.structurer and the output.themer plugins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Run the script <code>etc/structurer.sh</code> *after* you did an svn update.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise build and deploy them manually. Do your usual 'svn update', then ...
      </p>

       <source xml:space="preserve">
cd whiteboard/plugins/org.apache.forrest.plugin.internal.structurer/
$FORREST_HOME/tools/ant/bin/ant local-deploy
cd ../org.apache.forrest.plugin.output.themer/
$FORREST_HOME/tools/ant/bin/ant local-deploy
      </source>

    <section id="newSeed">
      <title>Seed a new project</title>
      <p> Go to the directory where you want to seed a new project and seed it ...
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve">cd ~/src/ 
mkdir v2 
cd v2/ 
forrest seed-v2 </source>
     <note>
       For the moment we will use a special seed template called seed-v2. We still 
        need to fix issues of the dispatcher, so that it really can replace old 
        fashion skins. Like performance, standalone contracts, other testing output/input formats - using POJO based 
        processing will help solving this.  All this will happen in the v2 seed-target until the dispatcher will 
        be released to the stable plugins. So make regular updates of your forrest-trunk to keep track.
     </note>
     <warning>
      The way we develop contracts will/may change with introduction of java-based processing 
      (for certain parts) rather then xsl. Please keep this in mind
        and help updating the documentation by sending patches. TIA. ;-)
     </warning>
    </section>
    <section id="forrestProperties">
      <title>Modify forrest.properties</title>
      <p>
        Make sure to tell forrest to use the dispatcher plugins. Of course, if you are
        using "seed-v2" then this is already done. If you are converting an existing site to use 
        dispatcher, then do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edit forrest.properties to add the required plugins:
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve">
project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.output.themer,org.apache.forrest.plugin.internal.structurer
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="testing">
      <title>Test your new "dispatcher" based project</title>
      <p> 
        Now you have finished the preparation and the setup to finally do
        <code>'forrest run'</code> and
        point your browser to <code>http://localhost:8888/</code> and you will see the default
        dispatcher-based site.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="availableContracts">
      <title>Available contracts</title>
      <p> 
       To start working with the dispatcher, you need to know which contracts you can use. 
       If you used the seed-v2 then the Samples tab will lead to 
       the available contracts.</p>
      <p>
       Forrestbar is another way to see available contracts. See the menu point "Devs"
       (ls.contracts and/or ls.contracts.project)
      </p><p>
        Now point your browser to e.g. <code>http://localhost:8888/ls.contracts.html</code> 
        ... On this page you will find all contracts that you can use in your project.
      </p>
