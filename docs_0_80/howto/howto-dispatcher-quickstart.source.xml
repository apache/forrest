   <title>Dispatcher quickstart</title>

  </header><body><section id="Intended Audience"><title>Intended Audience</title>
    <p>People who are helping to develop the Dispatcher.</p>
    <warning> The "Dispatcher" (previously known as "Views") is new functionality which is 
      still in development phase. That is why it is in the "whiteboard" section 
      of Forrest. This document will also need to change to keep pace.
      We are working at the moment on moving this plugin
      from the whiteboard into the core plugins.
    </warning>
  </section><section id="Purpose"><title>Purpose</title>
    <p>
      This document will get you started. We will Dispatcher-enable an
      existing site and show how to add/remove ready-made contacts.
      Then we will discuss how add your own new contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document encourages developers to get involved with
      fine-tuning and testing the dispatcher. Please help to
      enhance the current core contracts so that people do not
      need to re-invent the wheel.
    </p>
  </section><section id="Prerequisites"><title>Prerequisites</title>
    <ul>
      <li>Using Forrest trunk of SVN (i.e. forrest-0.8-dev).
        Must be after r373699, preferably head of trunk.
      </li>
      <li>Followed the installation instructions below.</li>
      <li>You have an existing forrest site and want to try the
        new Dispatcher. Otherwise create a 'forrest seed-sample' site.</li>
    </ul>
  </section><section id="Steps"><title>Steps</title>
    <note> When developing with the dispatcher we assume you are using 'forrest 
      run' and the following workflow "change files -&gt; refresh browser".<br/> 
      Installing a mozilla browser and the 
      <a href="site:forrestbar">Forrestbar</a> helps a lot with developing,
      but is not necessary.
    </note>

    <section id="patch">
      <title>Get ready</title>
      <ul>
        <li>Do 'svn update' or at least use r373699.</li>
        <li>Apply the patch from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-796</li>
        <li>Deploy both dispatcher plugins.</li>

      <p>
        Copy the default structurer for the pelt theme and make local changes.
      </p>
      <note>
        At this stage of rapid development of the Dispatcher, be sure to keep
        your copy synchronised. Use 'diff' against the known svn version of
        the core pelt.fv to track your local changes.
        Also please consider contributing new contracts and changes to the
        default structurers to the Forrest projects. That eases your local
        version management and everyone will benefit.
      </note>
      <ul>
        <li>Copy THEMER_PLUGIN/resources/themes/pelt.fv into your project at
          PROJECT_HOME/src/documentation/resources/themes/pelt.fv
          (create the new directory folder first).
        </li>
        <li>Re-start 'forrest run'</li>
        <li>localhost:8888/index.html ... See the same view, now structured
          by us.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From here on there is no need to re-start 'forrest run'. Just edit
        the structurer and see the effect.
      </p>

    <section id="remove-default-contract">
      <title>Remove a default contract</title>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove one of the search boxes. Edit your pelt.fv and find the
          "search-input" contract (there are two). Comment one out.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="add-default-contract">
      <title>Add a default contract</title>
      <p>
        Forrest provides many default contracts. If you are using the
        Forrestbar then choose "Devs =&gt; ls.contracts". Otherwise visit
        localhost:8888/ls.contracts.html
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          See the usage detail for your chosen contract via the abovementioned list.
          e.g. "siteinfo-compliance-links"
        </li>
        <li>
          Insert it at the appropriate point in your structurer. Note that it
          will need to go inside the appropriate CSS hook, e.g.
        <source xml:space="preserve">  ...
  &lt;forrest:hook name="footer"&gt;
    &lt;forrest:contract name="siteinfo-compliance-links"/&gt;
    ...
</source>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Notice that you did not need to copy any other code to your project space.
        Forrest finds the default contract in its core (the theme.core plugin).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="add-project-contract">
      <title>Add a new project contract</title>
      <warning>
        Carefully consider the purpose of your contracts. If they are useful
        in a wider context, then they belong in plugins or the core of Forrest.
        See below for further discussion on this important topic.
      </warning>
      <p>
        Project-based contracts are defined in theme-specific and
        output-format-specific directory structure, e.g.
        PROJECT_HOME/src/documentation/resources/themes/THEME_NAME/OUTPUT_FORMAT/
      </p>
      <p>
       Project-based contracts common to all themes go in
        PROJECT_HOME/src/documentation/resources/themes/common/OUTPUT_FORMAT/
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started quickly (it is not a project-based contract but a demo),
        copy one of the default contracts. e.g. copy siteinfo-current-time.ft to become siteinfo-doodad.ft ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Copy THEMER_PLUGIN/resources/themes/common/html/siteinfo-current-time.ft
          into your project at
          PROJECT_HOME/src/documentation/resources/themes/common/html/siteinfo-doodad.ft
          (create the new directory folders first).
        </li>
        <li>
          Edit it to suit. Replace all occurrences of "siteinfo-current-time" with
          "siteinfo-doodad" and make your other changes (e.g. the text and the
          javascript function).
        </li>
        <li>
          Declare your new contract in your structurer as done above for adding a
          default contract.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        See a list of your project-based contracts and their usage notes via 
        Forrestbar "Devs =&gt; ls.contracts.project". Otherwise visit
        localhost:8888/ls.contracts.project.html
      </p>
