    <title>Dispatcher (Draft - feature under development)</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <warning> The "dispatcher" is new functionality which is still in 
      development phase. That is why it is in the "whiteboard" section of the 
      Forrest distribution. We are working at the moment on moving this plugin
      from the whiteboard into the core plugins. </warning>
    <section id="introduction">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p> As stated in the <link href="site:v0.80//documentation/skins">Skin 
        documentation </link> the aim of the Forrest skins is to provide many 
        capabilities so that extra skins are not needed. Experience showed that 
        many Forrest users still decided to create a new skin because the 
        default skin did not offer the features that they wanted or they "just" 
        needed extra content in some pages. We introduced skinconf.xml where 
        the user could configure some features of skins but it was up to the 
        skin to support it and did not solve the problem to add page specific 
        extra content. That led us to develop a new concept of creating skins 
        (we called the result "themes") which would be more easily extensible 
        by a user. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="background">
      <title>Background</title>
      <p> The problem with the forrest skins so far has been that even if 
        "only" the design changed (html-skeleton), we still had to write a 
        completely new skin and implement all functionality. Another problem 
        was that the functionality was not easily extensible by a user. We 
        decided to support a standard regarding naming conventions for css 
        elements. This standard has been developed on the <link href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/skins"> OSCOM 
        website</link>, where you can find some more background information.</p>
      <section id="nc-definition">
        <title>Definition of naming conventions</title>
        <p> "A naming convention is an attempt to systematize names in a field 
          so they unambiguously convey similar information in a similar 
          manner." <link href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_conventions">wikipedia</link>

      <section id="leather">
        <title>leather-dev</title>
        <p> That led to the development of the "leather-dev" skin which 
          established a semantic container approach for div elements. 
          Leather-dev evolved from the "pelt" skin and almost used the same 
          functionality (contracts). We had started to encapsulate functional 
          code into templates, but there have been still in 4 xsl files and without 
          any documentation what they are doing and how to use them. The 
          problems with leather-dev was pointed out in the mail "<link href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=forrest-dev&amp;m=111049344517653">status on leather-dev?</link>". The main proplem was to limit users to 
          only one html-skeleton was way too limiting regarding design. Since 
          we had now grouped functionality in named container we were ready to 
          start the dispatcher (aka forrest:views).</p>

    <section id="dispatcher">
      <title>Dispatcher - advanced separation of concerns</title>
      <p> The aim of the "dispatcher" concept is to provide a flexible 
        framework for creating site and page specific layout in different 
        formats from different content through an advanced seperation of 
        concerns.</p>
      <p>The dispatcher is a filter that limits the data-model to a minimum by 
        only requesting what the strucuter (e.g. common.fv) need. This leads to 
        a different URL handling focus - away from document centric. A document 
        can (but do not have to) be behind a certain URL. Like said a 
        structurer can request any given data as input not only a document and 
        the forrest core contracts (like navigation). It may be the main 
        enhancement in comparison to skins that this concept let you easily 
        extend the default data models provided by forrest.</p>
      <p>Since the dispatcher has implemented a fallback concept it makes 
        maintenance of custom themes which are based on forrest core ones very 
        easy and less time consuming. The principal is to override or extend 
        only certain parts (contracts) of the core. This is based on the 
        observation that normally only a small percentage of core skin 
        contracts have been changed. At the same time the new plugin system 
        emerged. Plugins are a way of extending Forrest to satisfy 
        site-specific needs. This includes to provide plugin specific 
        contracts.</p>
      <section id="contracts">
        <title>Contracts - grouped functionality</title>
        <p>The result of the leather-dev development were grouped functionality 
          in named container. We gave those code snippets names (based on their 
          functionality) and called them contracts. This naming enabled us to 
          keep the contract separate from the position code itself. Further 
          since major parts of the code of skins never have been documentended 
          we started to add for each contract a description and an explanation 
          how to use this contract. The skinconf.xml gave an excellent 
          source for this documentation effort, since it described most 
          features of the pelt skin.</p>
          <p>Contracts are standalone, self explaining, configurable 
            pieces of xsl templates created out of pure maintaining reasons.</p>
