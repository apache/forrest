      <title>Introduction</title>
<note>
This is the <strong>development</strong> version of Apache Forrest which can
be obtained from the Subversion repository or from a code snapshot.
See the notes for obtaining and <link href="site:v0.80//build">Building Forrest</link>.
</note>
      <p>
      This page describes some changes to Apache Forrest that affect people who are
      upgrading to the 0.8-dev version.
      If you have other issues, then please discuss on either the
      <link href="site:mail-lists/forrest-dev">dev</link> or
      <link href="site:mail-lists/forrest-user">user</link>
      mailing lists.
      As more experience is gained, this document will be updated.  
      </p>
      <p>
      (If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.7 then you will need
      to see the notes for the <link href="site:v0.60//upgrading_06">previous</link>
      upgrade.)

    <section id="new">
      <title>New Features</title>
      <p>
        The following list shows some of the key new features
        (for the full list of changes, see the
        <link href="site:changes">change log</link>).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li/>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As usual, do a "forrest seed site" in a new directory and compare the
        forrest.properties and skinconf.xml with that of your project.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="clean">
      <title>Run a clean target after upgrade</title>
      <p>
        Do 'forrest clean-work' in each of your projects. This also removes
        the old Cocoon disk cache.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="tips">
      <title>General upgrade tips</title>
      <p>
      Synchronise your project's skinconf.xml and forrest.properties files.
      </p>
      <p>
      Take advantage of the separation of concerns. In a new workspace,
      create a fresh
      '<code>forrest seed</code>' site, then tweak its forrest.properties
      and skinconf.xml until it reflects your old site.
      When it is ready, replace your project's skinconf.xml and
      forrest.properties files.
      Any remaining issues would concern other aspects of your configuration,
      such as site.xml and your actual content.
